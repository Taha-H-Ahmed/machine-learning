       "  'review': \"[h1]  This game ruined my life [/h1] \\nI recommend everyone to play Dota 2 and not LoL nor Mobile Legends\\nDon't get me wrong, I am not hating or anything. I was from Dota 1 for like 3-4 years before Dota 2 was released and it didn't caught my attention to adapt the new theme of it.\\n\\nDota 2 is a great game, an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must (unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). Monster gamers are real.\\n\\nDota 2 has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that..\\n\\n[h1] THE COMEBACKS ARE REAL!!! [/h1]\\nThis game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten.\\n\\nAll in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.\\n\\nP.S. Calm down, it's just a game...... YAWA!\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]\"You learn how to learn,  how to lose and most importantly you learn about you.\"[/h1]\\n\\nAlright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over  the span of 3 years.\\n\\n1. general thoughts and how i started:\\nI was  15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact  this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that  saying \"nothing\" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional assholes. \\n\\n2. Did i waste my youth?:\\nSo this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts \"lets learn music\"  or \"lets study\" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of \"improving\" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.\\n\\n3. time invested into dota2:\\nEVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of \"oh man i shouldve learned something  with this time.... i couldve been amazing now..\" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It\\'s kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much fucking time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.\\n\\nREWARDING: dota 2 is FUCKIGN REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start  understanding how to farm -> M .  M . R \\n\\nYOUR RANK GOES FUCKIGN UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)). \\n\\nReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY fucked up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do \\n\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive) \\n[i]hope someone will ever read this lol hit me up if you wanna chat[/i]',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]  This game ruined my life [/h1] \\nI recommend everyone to play Dota 2 and not LoL nor Mobile Legends\\nDon't get me wrong, I am not hating or anything. I was from Dota 1 for like 3-4 years before Dota 2 was released and it didn't caught my attention to adapt the new theme of it.\\n\\nDota 2 is a great game, an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must (unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). Monster gamers are real.\\n\\nDota 2 has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that..\\n\\n[h1] THE COMEBACKS ARE REAL!!! [/h1]\\nThis game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten.\\n\\nAll in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.\\n\\nP.S. Calm down, it's just a game...... YAWA!\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]\"You learn how to learn,  how to lose and most importantly you learn about you.\"[/h1]\\n\\nAlright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over  the span of 3 years.\\n\\n1. general thoughts and how i started:\\nI was  15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact  this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that  saying \"nothing\" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional assholes. \\n\\n2. Did i waste my youth?:\\nSo this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts \"lets learn music\"  or \"lets study\" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of \"improving\" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.\\n\\n3. time invested into dota2:\\nEVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of \"oh man i shouldve learned something  with this time.... i couldve been amazing now..\" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It\\'s kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much fucking time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.\\n\\nREWARDING: dota 2 is FUCKIGN REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start  understanding how to farm -> M .  M . R \\n\\nYOUR RANK GOES FUCKIGN UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)). \\n\\nReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY fucked up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do \\n\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive) \\n[i]hope someone will ever read this lol hit me up if you wanna chat[/i]',\n",

       "  'review': \"One of the best and most influential games ever and a game very near and dear to my heart. Please don't play it.\\n\\nThere is NOTHING more satisfying in this world then winning a 1 hour + length match in this game. Both teams get extremely personal with each other, both teams doing everything in their power to make sure that time spent belongs to them, there will be a couple of central characters in the match who just dominate the battlefield and both teams are doing everything to make sure that character can come through and do their job.\\n\\nFuck sex, fuck money, fuck fame. In that one moment, when you win, you feel like the whole world is yours and the people you might have never ever been friendly with, suddenly can turn into great friends the moment after that victory.\\n\\nIts incredible and I haven't seen a game that is able to create these miracle situations as often as this one does. \\n\\nBut thats the whole problem with this game, to get that situation you need a well balanced match, you need decent team mates, you need personal will power and skill, and you need time. \\n\\nIf ANY of those things don't line up, you are in for a massive shit show. I can't even tell you at this point how many terrible matches I have had. Its terrible for your mental health. Even when you finally get decent at the game, there will always be better people and you are still playing a team game. Its depressing and you constantly have to be confronted with that playing this game. In a way its humbling and great for self growth, but in another way its absolutely unhealthy and that kind of mental torture is something people shouldn't subject themselves to.\\n\\nEven after reaching immortal multiple times there is still so much room for improvement. As I grow older I just see myself losing access to that kind of time constantly. In the past 5 hours of free time was nothing and I wouldn't grow tired of it at all. But now I have responsibilities and people needing my help, a 40 minute match is something daunting when you get to that point.You just end up wishing you could pause the game like with single player games or wondering if you couldn't spend the hours in Dota to finish up playing other games you wanted to play. \\n\\nThis isn't just a long game, its an infinite game where you are the deciding factor on when to stop, depending on the type of person you are, that stopping point might take a long ass time like it did for me.\\n\\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\\n\\nWhen I started this game I was a mess of a person, I had barely any friends, I was terrified of talking to other people on the mic and the only thing I cared about was winning and getting better. Once I got even a little better I would tell people what to do in a horrible way and expect them to listen and even thank me for the insults I threw at them.\\n\\nI learned from all of that and improved myself as a person, I got a lot more empathetic, learned how to talk like a heartfelt leader, learned how to socially make fun and talk to people and got much better at critical thinking and problem solving.\\n\\nBut as I look back, I just wonder if there wasn't a better way to go about it, words can't describe the extreme lows Dota can put you in. Dota shaped me as a person and helped me a lot, but for everything it helped me with, it equally took away a lot as well. \\n\\nNo matter how much I love this game, I could never recommend this to someone I don't know very well and that I KNOW could handle this game normally. This game has the potential to take so much from you. Play it at your own discretion and make sure you know what you are getting yourself into.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'There is a lot to be said about Dota 2. The most important thing you should know:\\nThe game is wonderful and very kind to beginners ... While they are in the menu.\\nThe community is not only positive, but also possesses the skills of telepathy. They will say many things about your relatives which you never even imagined to be true but they are the smart bunch you should listen or you will not get very far in this game.\\nAlso, one of the advantages is that many doctors, physicians play Dota 2 and they can diagnose your mental and physical abilities without any problems.\\nIt is thanks to Dota 2 that you can finally find your long-lost father or find out that your mother loved spending time with many wonderful men from this game behind you back)\\nIf you want to play Dota with a friend, it is better that you are physically stronger than him, because after a couple of dozen matches you will want to beat the shit out of him\\nIf your team won, it is only thanks to your divine skill.\\nIf you lost, then only because the team of stupid clowns, you carried the game as best you could.\\nIn Dota, the most important thing is to find a scapegoat only to justify that you were playing \"allegedly good\" but others are the scum but you only you are the \"pro\" you are the carry you are the best you lose only because gaben sends secret agents to ruin your game if not gaben you\\'ve would have had 7k mmr\\nBe sure to remember how the support stole one last hit from you, or how you were left alone without a farm. As a mid-lane, staying afk for 15 minutes and no ss or gang while the enemies humiliated your team. In cases of complaints against you, this will help to bring a counter-argument in your favor. IT is better for them to find a scapegoat from the very beginning and start slowly presenting him for a shitty game that he allegedly ruined.\\nAlthough i advice you not to tilt or blame someone even if they are bad or ruining the game because you will be the one who will get all the reports in this game no one likes smartasses\\nDon\\'t try to play Dota for fun, it\\'s almost impossible. After a certain number of games, even victories will not please you.\\nOnly balanced gameplay no more 6 hours a day will help you not to get raged always make breaks from this game as long as you need\\nDon\\'t try to eliminate dota entirely from your life that will crush you\\nmake friends with it and play how you desire not how gaben imagined it for you\\nDota matchmaking is made strictly to maintain balance so if you had interest for high rating absent skill forget it\\nDon\\'t count numbers play for yourself valv always gonna find way to fuck you',\n",

       "  'review': \"No denying this GAME IS BEAUTIFUL and the Veteran community is very UNDERSTANDING. I had achieved what People find very hard to do in their Lives. I had quit Dota for over 2 years. It was a MISTAKE RETURNING to the game. But here I was, teaching a friend.\\nIt really felt like DOTA had become a very player friendly in the past 2 years. It took a day or two to get back to normal DOTA playing habit. I was playing UNRANKED and It felt good, I was on a roll. Playing tens of games a day. Slowly realising it's pulling me back. \\nAnd then all of a sudden I had an urge to press the RANKED button which had a new Roles option. I played my first ranked game as a Shadow Demon (A support), won my lane and surprisingly had a narrow win. My team did not know how my hero or the items worked. The feeling was different. \\nAt first I just thought these people in my team are just miserable turd burglars but No I was wrong. They made what would be a simple game to an absolute sh%#hole of a game to be in.\\nIf I say that the next few games had given me the trashiest people in the entire universe, it would be an understatement. I HAD NEVER FELT WORSE. \\nFirst, they cannot be reasoned with. Secondly, the amount of flame, rage and incessant ramblings I discovered in these games was overwhelmingly DEMEANING. People flaming to the point you have NO CHOICE BUT TO ABANDON.\\nI stopped my RANKED venture and went for a NORMAL one and boy did it kept getting worse. \\nI'll tell you guys it's EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to enrage me, but here I was getting angry at these creatures, Raising my voice to my newbie Friend who had now loved the game but eventually agreed It was time for us to stop. In just a couple of days I went from being a perfectly reasonable, calm & friendly personality who would encourage people if they are playing bad to being an absolutely miserable person with anger issues screaming and yelling etc. \\n2 days Ago I uninstalled the game. I still don't know why  I have these mixed thoughts. I have spent a decent amount of time to understand how the game mechanics works and quite honestly would like to summarize that I have wasted an important part my childhood, jeopardised my mental health on several occasions, had a fight with my father over this stupid game and overall took a giant dump on my Life and guess what I still love this game.\\nI wouldn't wish this on anyone and would sincerely recommend every player to take care of themselves, Don't waste too much time on this game. If you win or lose  doesn't matter, take a break, go out for a walk. Call your family & friends. Confirm that you aren't that same miserable person from that game that stupid game you play.\\nThe community has somewhat grown up from 2014. My rank opening game. A bloodseeker screaming on his mic and typing a rant every 2 seconds for 45 minutes flaming his teamates. I still remember how shi%%y it felt to this day. It was not worth it back then, Its not worth it now.\\nAnd to any person coming here...\\n[b] DOTA IS FREE, BUT NOTHING IN LIFE IS FREE [/b] .\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1] 9/10 [/h1]\\nLooking back now, my first exposure to Dota was Dota 1 6.78 b version. At the time, I didn't know much about Dota at all, but its fun-filled gameplay still fascinated me at the time. July 15, 2014, was the first time I came into contact with Dota 2. Compared with Dota 1, Dota 2 not only optimized a lot in UI, model, operation, and experience, but the version update after that has also kept Dota 2 alive. Looking back now, the period from 2014 to 2016 was probably my favorite time for Dota 2. At that time, there was no clear role positioning, and I mostly knew little about the game. In the end, it took more than 2,000 hours, and I only got about the rank of archon 4, which was 2800MMR at that time. The 7.0 version update is the biggest change for DOTA. The newly added talent tree system and various game updates even made many people call this game Dota 3 at that time. While the game keeps getting better, my interest in Dota 2 has been dwindling ever since. The changes are too big, and I don't have much time to understand these changes. Many times I will find that my understanding of heroes and items is still stuck in the previous version. Around 2019, I temporarily gave up on Dota 2.\\n\\nAround November 2020, I tried Dota 2 again. With my original understanding of the game, I won Legend IV in the positioning match on this account, 3700MMR. But as I continued to play, I found that the game environment of this game started to get worse and worse. Many Legend and even Ancient players don't even know some basic game operations and awareness, they will make some incredible operations in the ranked match. And there is no longer that kind of tolerance between players. Players who don't understand the content of the game won't listen to other people's advice at all, and even give up on themselves. I'm used to the verbal abuse between teams. After a game is over, many opponents like to type slightly insulting words like Noob, GG EZ, which makes people feel that the game environment full of competitive style in the past is no longer. In addition, although Legend is not a very high rank, I not only find that the matching queue time required here is getting longer and longer, usually, 5-15 minutes or even longer, and this rank has a lot of players who lack understanding of the game also surprised me. After all, the rank of Legend IV can already be in the top 30% of this game, and the rank below this, which I have experienced before, the current rank between 1000MMR and 3000MMR is even more difficult for me to imagine. Undoubtedly, either this is the irrationality of the positioning mechanism itself or the overall decline of the player's level.\\n\\nThese are all my opinions. I also finally decided to give up Dota 2 again, and I'm afraid I won't be coming back. For new players, the learning cost of Dota 2 is too high. At the same time, it only takes 100 hours to play the ranked game in the game, which makes many new players go directly to the ranked game after 100 hours of games, which will destroy the game environment in the ranked match. And now the overall game environment is also full of maliciousness for new players. Many players do not even have a tolerant attitude towards new players in ordinary matchmaking modes, and the content of Dota 2's tutorials is too little. \\n\\nI really like Dota 2, and I really agree that it's a masterpiece. But why is Dota 2's user base and word of mouth declining compared to League of Legends now? I think it does have a lot of problems, and those problems are more focused on the game environment. I personally think that this game takes a certain amount of time as a learning cost for new players and Dota old players, and the current game environment is often too harsh. If you want to try it, you must be mentally prepared.\\n\\nFinally, farewell to you, Dota 2, and thank you for being with me for the 9 years I've read. I will never, never forget you.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"If you're new... this might help and it definitely helped for me. Take advantage of the great pve aspect to Dota~\\n- Download a custom AI script from the workshop page... I recommend Adam's/Ranked AI script and Bot Experiment.\\n- Just practice against bots at first. Set your team as hard level while the enemy team is easy. Do that until you get a general feel for the game and can consistently win.\\n- Then... bump it up~ so do hard vs medium... then hard vs hard... then hard vs unfair...\\n- Once you are consistently winning bot matches with hard level teammate bots vs unfair enemy bots... start decreasing your team's level~ this is where training wheels come off haha.\\n- Do medium vs unfair... and see if you can consistently win.\\n- Eventually~ you'll come to easy vs unfair and this basically forces you to really know how your hero and Dota works if you want to consistently win.\\n- Once you're at the easy teammate bots vs unfair enemy bots and can win consistently... try to do it across various carry heroes.\\n- After doing this enough... you should know how every hero works... their power spikes... how items work... how to adapt against different heroes... etc~ if you're at this point then try pvp and you'll be better off than a majority of new players who decided to learn during the game versus doing their research before playing.\\n\\n*Remember that bot games can potentially teach bad habits but~ you'll at least learn key concepts to Dota with laning... how to control your lane... power spikes... how fragile or tanky a hero is... what each hero does and their abilities... items... how to rotate aka split push or not... early game versus late game... etc~ familiarity matters more versus actually winning the bot games. Sure you can cheese your way to victory like with playing Crystal Maiden and other supports as hard carries but that isn't the goal... the goal is to understand how the game works and become familiar with it.\\n*This training method only teaches you how to play carries... if you're looking to learn how to play supports or in general what are called position 3 to 5 heroes aka heroes who will have less farm in an actual game... this method won't quite work. But imo it's important that players understand how carries work because everything else follows through from there. Dota is about playing off your carries as they statistically will be the strongest heroes late game so learning support/noncarry roles will come easier in real games.\\n♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡\\nPros~\\n- So much depth and variety. There are always new strategies... no match will ever feel the same and requires different approaches... it's why people can main this game as the skill cap is nearly infinite and your knowledge and decision making will always be growing. And it's also why people generally don't feel bored with the game... it just always feels fresh and new and it's why I managed to play 200+ hours with literally only custom ai bots.\\n- Every hero feels unique to play and so you'll likely be able to find different gameplay styles you like but also get a chance to just always have different ways to play and have fun.\\n- The item system provides a lot of customizable ways to play your heroes or to adapt to the enemy and their strategies. \\n- Like in Paladins... there is a balanced ecosystem/counters to heroes but with room for skill to allow outplays against hard counters.\\n\\nCons~\\n- Extremely high learning curve. This is the general issue with moba games unlike fps games because it really takes a lot of knowledge to learn how the 118 heroes or so work along with hundreds of items. Add in mechanics like magical resistance/magical damage vs physical damage... etc~\\n- A very team role reliant game generally speaking... sure in bot games you can 1 vs 9 basically but~ in real games you really need to hope everyone is holding up to their roles. If your carries don't know how to last hit or farm or take advantage of pushes or picks... there is nothing you can do about it as a noncarry. Sure you can do your best to literally spoon feed them the best you can... but it's how it is. This isn't Paladins or something where you can potentially become a damage/support hybrid... in Dota 2 as a support you'll be limited based on statistics of how you just simply won't gain as much attack speed or damage over time compared to enemy carries.\\n- The drafting stage to games is important... aka what heroes you all pick will really determine how a game goes. This is both a good and bad thing as it makes for example watching dota games really fun to see which heroes are picked but for players... this means a team that mindlessly picks will get punished. Not only do you need the traditional position 1 to 5 role of hard carry > hard/semi carry > semi carry/offlane > soft support > hard support... but some heroes might not work the best with each other. \\n♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡\\nOverall~ super fun game and it can be played super seriously with rank and the professional scene but super casual with playing random games or just only bots like I did. Like I had so much fun against just bots. Only issue is the learning curve~\",\n",

       "  'review': '\"You learn how to learn, how to lose and most importantly you learn about you.\"\\n\\nAlright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over the span of 3 years.\\n\\n1. general thoughts and how i started:\\nI was 15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that saying \"nothing\" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. \\n\\n2. Did i waste my youth?:\\nSo this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts \"lets learn music\" or \"lets study\" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of \"improving\" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.\\n\\n3. time invested into dota2:\\nEVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of \"oh man i shouldve learned something with this time.... i couldve been amazing now..\" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It\\'s kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for school again i realized how much ♥♥♥♥ing time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.\\n\\nREWARDING: dota 2 is ♥♥♥♥IGN REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start understanding how to farm -> M . M . R \\n\\nYOUR RANK GOES ♥♥♥♥IGN UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)). \\n\\nReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY ♥♥♥♥ed up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do \\n\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive) \\nhope someone will ever read this lol hit me up if you wanna chat',\n",

Maybe the reader now giggling and drawing an image on his/her mind says this guy is a nerd. No im not, I\\'m a fitness guy with good shape studying engineering, which I had a social life in the past . I lost too much things on my life most of them are privacy/personal things not going to write them down but one of them is my education 24 years old still studying engineering because of this game.  If you are going to say that you can manage your day between playing \"DOTA\" and studying or working you are wrong because the average match time is 35 min *only 1 match. So 35 min × 3 games per day = 105 min. Not mentioning that some games exceed 1 hour if both teams played well. Please take this as an advice from 24 years old guy who has been suffering for 3 years because of this game I sucked on education you can be better than me and quit, I destroyed my dream and now im trying to bring it back wish me good luck.\\n\\nPlease this is not a \"joke post\" and this advice aiming on teenagers who want to achieve their future dreams just don\\'t play this game its fuckin AWESOME game but you have to pay your life for it.\\n\\nYour choice life or Dota and this is not a joke if you throw my words away just please save my comment on your favorites and come back after 3 years don\\'t cry if your life got ruined.\\n\\nSave my comment if you don\\'t want to take my advice you can visit this comment again.\\n\\nMost of positive reviews are written by Valve\\'s agents believe me.',\n",

I was from HoN for like 2-3 years before Dota 2 was released and tried LoL and actually enjoyed it for a bit but then went back to HoN.\\n\\nDota 2 is a great game, an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must (unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). Monster gamers are real.\\n\\nDota 2 has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that..\\n\\n[h1][b]THE COMEBACKS ARE REAL!!![/b][/h1]\\nThis game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten.\\n\\nAll in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.\\n\\nP.S. Calm down, it's just a game.......\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This is a good game. One of the best ever made maybe. Professionals will probably debate this fact on the basis of the finer mechanics and the balance, etc, but the fact remains that this game is not one of the world's most successful e-sports without reason.\\n\\nBut understand this: It is not fun. You are not allowed to have fun in DOTA2. The only purpose you are allowed to have for picking up this game and playing it, is to become a master player. Being only okay, or just good at it is a cardinal sin for which you will be shamed and humiliated. If you are a new player then you better be a fast learner because the players you encounter will shun you for not knowing every mechanic in the game within your first 5 minutes of playing. \\n\\nSo, for the community of the game to allow you to participate in their holy ritual you must:\\n - make sure you have extensively researched every hero, play style, tactic and mechanic well before first installing\\n - play only against AI with no human witnesses until you have perfect muscle memory and flawless hand-eye coordination\\n - never make a mistake in a match against human players\\n\\nIf you meet all these criteria, and have the competitive mindset of a person whose only reason for existing is to pummel every competitor 50 feet into the earth, then you will enjoy your time invested into this game.\\n\\nBut even then you are never, NEVER allowed to have any fun. If fun is what you seek, keep on looking.\\n\\nEdit: spelling\",\n",

He feeds. You make a comment on the way he\\'s playing? He feeds. You\\'re asking him to stop feeding nicely? He feeds even more.\\n- The \"Pro\" : In your team,spend the whole game typing you the mistakes you made (while he\\'s not playing obviously) in the most arrogant possible way.\\nAnd THAT my friend is just a tiny sample among all the assholes you\\'re going to encounter in dota, on average you\\'re going to have ONE decent game out of 10 where people are just playing in a normal way. and the worst part of this is: after spending hours and hours and hours playing, you\\'re going to become one of these guys against your own will,because toxicity appeals toxicity,and you will probably hate yourself for it.\\nTo summarise: Dota 2 is a great game,well thought,strategic and highly addictive,but ruined by a community so toxic than even the guys who created Chernobyl are afraid of it.\\nIf you care about your mental sanity,if you get easily triggered,do yourself a favor and don\\'t play this game.it took me almost 8000 hours to realise that,and now I\\'m a salty fucker,don\\'t make the same mistake.\\nEdit: I still hate the game, and I\\'m still playing it, God save me.',\n",

Game is fun and all, but then you realize you\\'ve spent 1000+ hours in this rabbit hole and leave the game. You notice that your girlfriend\\'s not by your side anymore and that there is a weird note on the table saying, \"I\\'m leaving, and you can keep going mid as Techies, fucking libtard\". Later you see an eviction notice on your door as well as an email from your parents saying, \"You\\'re adopted\". You try to suppress your pain and misery by drinking healing salves and sipping bottle. You press time lapse, but life doesn\\'t go back to the way it used to be. Now your life consists of weekly battle cup tournaments and toxic teammates who know more about the mother that\\'s adopted you than her adopted son (you). Suddenly, you wake up in the middle of the night, cold drops of sweat dripping down your face. You see your girlfriend next to you and realize that it was a bad dream, and that you can 1v1 solo mid that loser who badmouthed your mom. Actually, wait. If you are reading this and you have Dota 2 installed, then you have probably woken up from that weird dream where you had a girlfriend and a glimpse of social life. Go back to playing Dota, champ, you are still yet to reach that sweet 1000 mmr. \\nP.s. Аниме на аве, здоровья маме. АУФ ДЕД ИНСАЙД',\n",

       "  'review': '\"You learn how to learn, how to lose and most importantly you learn about you.\"\\n\\nAlright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over the span of 3 years.\\n\\n1. general thoughts and how i started:\\nI was 15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that saying \"nothing\" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\\n\\n2. Did i waste my youth?:\\nSo this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts \"lets learn music\" or \"lets study\" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of \"improving\" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.\\n\\n3. time invested into dota2:\\nEVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of \"oh man i shouldve learned something with this time.... i couldve been amazing now..\" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It\\'s kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for school again i realized how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.\\n\\nREWARDING: dota 2 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start understanding how to farm -> M . M . R\\n\\nYOUR RANK GOES ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)).\\n\\nReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do\\n\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive)\\nhope someone will ever read this lol hit me up if you wanna chat',\n",

       "  'review': \"One of the best and most influential games ever and a game very near and dear to my heart. Please don't play it.\\n\\nThere is NOTHING more satisfying in this world then winning a 1 hour + length match in this game. Both teams get extremely personal with each other, both teams doing everything in their power to make sure that time spent belongs to them, there will be a couple of central characters in the match who just dominate the battlefield and both teams are doing everything to make sure that character can come through and do their job.\\n\\n♥♥♥♥ sex, ♥♥♥♥ money, ♥♥♥♥ fame. In that one moment, when you win, you feel like the whole world is yours and the people you might have never ever been friendly with, suddenly can turn into great friends the moment after that victory.\\n\\nIts incredible and I haven't seen a game that is able to create these miracle situations as often as this one does. \\n\\nBut thats the whole problem with this game, to get that situation you need a well balanced match, you need decent team mates, you need personal will power and skill, and you need time. \\n\\nIf ANY of those things don't line up, you are in for a massive ♥♥♥♥ show. I can't even tell you at this point how many terrible matches I have had. Its terrible for your mental health. Even when you finally get decent at the game, there will always be better people and you are still playing a team game. Its depressing and you constantly have to be confronted with that playing this game. In a way its humbling and great for self growth, but in another way its absolutely unhealthy and that kind of mental torture is something people shouldn't subject themselves to.\\n\\nEven after reaching immortal multiple times there is still so much room for improvement. As I grow older I just see myself losing access to that kind of time constantly. In the past 5 hours of free time was nothing and I wouldn't grow tired of it at all. But now I have responsibilities and people needing my help, a 40 minute match is something daunting when you get to that point.You just end up wishing you could pause the game like with single player games or wondering if you couldn't spend the hours in Dota to finish up playing other games you wanted to play.\\n\\nThis isn't just a long game, its an infinite game where you are the deciding factor on when to stop, depending on the type of person you are, that stopping point might take a long ass time like it did for me.\\n\\nConclusion \\n\\nWhen I started this game I was a mess of a person, I had barely any friends, I was terrified of talking to other people on the mic and the only thing I cared about was winning and getting better. Once I got even a little better I would tell people what to do in a horrible way and expect them to listen and even thank me for the insults I threw at them.\\n\\nI learned from all of that and improved myself as a person, I got a lot more empathetic, learned how to talk like a heartfelt leader, learned how to socially make fun and talk to people and got much better at critical thinking and problem solving.\\n\\nBut as I look back, I just wonder if there wasn't a better way to go about it, words can't describe the extreme lows Dota can put you in. Dota shaped me as a person and helped me a lot, but for everything it helped me with, it equally took away a lot as well. \\n\\nNo matter how much I love this game, I could never recommend this to someone I don't know very well and that I KNOW could handle this game normally. This game has the potential to take so much from you. Play it at your own discretion and make sure you know what you are getting yourself into.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]Gameplay : 9/10\\nGraphic : 9/10\\nCommunity : -25/10 ( updated, people see this wrong and keep asking me.   \\nI wrote\" negative 25.\")\\n\\n\\nPlaying with friends: 11/10\\nCompetitiveness&balance: 11/10\\n[/h1]\\n----------------------------------------INTRO--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n         For those of you who aren\\'t familiar with the MOBA genre, here\\'s a quick explanation. There are two bases, each on opposing corners of the map, and one for each team. The objective is to destroy the opposing team\\'s base. Three roads, or lanes, connect the bases. Low-level units automatically and periodically spawn from each base in groups, and these soldiers travel down the three paths between the bases. As a result, there is always a battle going on in the trio of lanes.\\nIn addition, each team has three defensive towers in each lane on their side of the map, totaling nine towers per team. These structures deliver powerful attacks against enemy soldiers and players, but they can be destroyed through significant effort. Because of this, fights tend to center on the towers.\\n\\n         All of this happens automatically. Unlike in typical RTS games, you don\\'t have to collect resources, build structures, or train units. You only control your hero, which can level up and acquire a range of upgradeable powers. However, its role might best be described as support for the A.I. soldier units. Players help control the battlefronts and destroy enemy towers in the lanes. The idea is to to open your opponent\\'s base up to a direct attack by the A.I. and hero once the towers in a lane are gone. There are five players per team, which of course doesn\\'t divide into the three lanes equally. When a player dies, he respawns at the team\\'s base after a penalty period.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Overall:\\npros: A much better game than lol\\ncons: A much harder game than lol\\n\\nLMAO\\nquit playing trash game plz[/h1]\\n\\n----------------------------------------Pro&Con---------------------------------------------\\nPROS\\n\\n1,   All At Your Fingertips – players have access to ALL of the game\\'s heroes from the start. No need to unlock or purchase heroes. ( poor LOL)\\n2,  Snowball Easily – dying results in a loss of gold, can magnify the effects of snowballing(Buyback system can make sure you don\\'t lose a game with just one mistake).\\n3,  Huge Variety of Cosmetics and Skins – players can customize individual parts of their heroes from both valve and community. (weapons, armor, helmets, etc.).\\n4,   Custom Game Support – players can build their own custom games within Dota 2 (Pudge Wars, Tower defenses, Racing, Battleships, and more!)\\n5,   Skill-Based and Competitive – similar to LoL, Dota 2 is heavily reliant on a player\\'s skill, is very competitive, and has a large e-Sports scene.\\n\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\n1 , Dota directly affects on your life (social life) \\n2 , Time consuming( Avg about 45 min per game + additional queuing time(about 3-10 mins depends on your region))\\n3 , Hard for newbies ( up to 500 hrs bot practices at least ---usually about 800 hrs)\\n4 , hbp due to rage (you may having 3 r e t a r d s and peru feeder/feeders on your side of team)\\n[spoiler]5 , Addiction(the true e-drug)[/spoiler]\\n\\n---------------------------------------ADDITIONS---------------------------------------------\\n\\nDon\\'t spend too much money on treasures. All the rare items can be purchased through community market if you feel like you are not gonna get any of rare sets.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I always hate the sort of guy that comes with 4k hours + and says it's not worth it, but allow me to be that guy for a second.\\n\\nLet me start of by saying that I do not hate the game itself, rather it's the matchmaking and the people that populate the game I hate.\\n\\nGet ready for; frustration, tears, screamings, trying to be a psychologist for 40m, working around the issues of every single player, I'm through with this game, I'm freaking done I played 4.426 hours this, and the obvious question is why, why did I do it?\\n\\nWell people get adicted to all sorts of things, look at people that smoke, it's killing them slowly but they get a relief when they get anxious, dota was my tobacco when I felt the anxiety of the day to day life I would resort to dota to calm down the anxiety. The competitive aspect of it appealed to me, and I felt that with enough patiente and fidinig the right people to play with, I could give a shot to being professional no chance.\\n\\nFirt of all I was decent not crazy good or anything, but when I tried to be reasonable with my team, when I counter the enemy, when I played whatever role or hero was needed, in other words to help the team whatever their needs were.\\n\\nThe more I tried to be as understanding the more I failed, because people didn't want to play the game as it is design, instead they want to bring their issues into the table and for you to deal with them.\\n\\nAnd after playing up and down the the ranking ladder for a big time. I transition into a freaking range monster at times I would stop and listen to what I was saying and I could felt the toxicity driping off my mouth. I couldn't take it, when people  decided they were going to be afk because certain demands weren't meet or when someone got frustrated and proceded to feed and on and on and on.\\n\\nThat is my complain, make no mistake dota is highly competitive game, if the matchmaking doesn't match you with people on your level, your are going to roll on the spiral of frustration, and there's a lot of kids playing just for trolling purposes, the matchmaking sometime matches you with people that have 200 hours when you just simply wonder How?\\n\\nAvoid this massive pit of frustration. You'll thank me later when you have an anxiety free life.\\n\\nEl fideo Rubio.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] The most fantastic game that improves skillset used in everyday life! [/h1]\\n\\nAfter a couple of hours I already got the hang of the game. It is a real rewarding piece with a beautiful community that is keen on helping you improve and unleash your hidden potential. Even though I\\'ve achieved the highest Badge possible in the game (which is also a great and original idea to somewhat categorize players), I am still reminded day-by-day that I\\'m pretty new to the game and I should focus on polishing my skills, which is a huge help since I am somewhat a maximalist.\\n\\nThe Dev Team is amazing and fast to reply in cases of bugs, broken things throughout the game that would otherwise alter the potential outcome of important Ranked Matches. I would highly recommend it to people thinking about taking up a semester abroad or such since it does help You enourmously when it comes to foreign languages.\\n\\nAfter just 2 years I was fluent in Russian and Spanish even though I have never taken a class before and this allowed me to travel to St Petersburg and Barcelona taking my language skills to the next level. It\\'s easy to make friends, people have no prejudice when it comes to your Badge, Divine (highest rank in the system) players play with Heralds (lowest rank in the system) and enjoy spending some free time with their fellow bratushki. \\n\\nI would also like to thank Valve for the amazing support towards amateur and semi-professional teams, the sponsoring of various national tournaments all over the globe and the ability to connect with each other in real life through this amazing franchise. \\n\\n[h1] Finally a piece about some skills I have acquired throughout the game: [/h1]\\n\\n[b] Tenacity [/b]  - The game rewards You trying really hard to win games and works on pushing you even further. The higher your impact in games, the lower impact people it will match with you, resulting in you having to push even harder. Amazing!\\n\\n[b] International Communication [/b] - Understand people from all over the globe through simple words, hieroglyphs, and ancient text. Being able to acquire and share information in a new and intuitive way.\\n\\n[b] Leadership [/b] - Some people take the role of the good soldier and some that of the leader. With Power however comes Great Responsibility. You are ready to make calls and lead your team towards victory? Keep in mind that you will also be accounted for the consequences of a miscall. But in the end you will become more daring and even better at leading with example!\\n\\n[b] Analytical Skills [/b] - The more you play the more advanced you become and analysis, prediction and understanding of movement and thoughts of people you have never met before. Paired with your glorious Communication Skills you will be able to share and respond to any situation. You will effectively be able to see the future as it is!\\n\\n[b] Focus [/b] - While most games are circa 30 minutes long, [strike] some games can take an eternity[/strike] in some games you spend a wonderful 1,5 hrs time together with 9 other nice people who you learn to know during this experience. The longer the game lasts however, the harder it becomes since any small mistake you make can be the end of the struggle. You acquire the ability called Laser Focus: eyes on the goal, maximum efficiency, 0 error factor. High level players have iron nerves!\\n\\n[b] Personal Growth [/b] - As human beings we must understand that sometimes we win and sometimes we [strike] get stomped cuz there is a premuted accbuyer in my team[/strike] learn. After lost games we still are eager to learn from our mistakes, commend the people that accounted for the win on the opposing team and pat the weaker players on the back. Standing up after a failure is a key factor in creating something new, in evolving. DotA is a major enhancement in this area.\\n\\nGive it a try, enjoy your time and who knows we might meet in game! ;)\\nCheers,\\n[i] Daniel \"Zen\" Stirling [/i]',\n",

       "  'review': 'I originally played Dota when it was merely a UMS on WC3, so take this review for what it\\'s worth. \\n\\nDota 2 is an addictive experience; however, this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society. If that statement is an insufficient description of the game, continue reading.\\n\\nThis game is not for the casual gamer, this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game.\\nIf you play this game, I can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard. I have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play, no matter what you do, you will encounter someone who will complain about something you\\'re doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you. I can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with.\\n\\nSo here are what I consider the pros and cons of the game:\\n\\nPros\\n-This is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing.\\n\\n-Free to play with optional cosmetic costs.\\n\\n-Gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection. This, in effect, increases replayability tremendously.\\n\\n-Wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer.\\n\\n-Winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more. This in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game.\\n\\nCons\\n-This game has a steep learning curve, believe me, there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance. Unlike hero customization in League of legends, not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either. It can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection, but thus is DOTA.\\n\\n-Secondary to the steep learning curve, games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team. This can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of \"fundamentals of gameplay\" video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have. Suffice to say, many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team, the player loses gold and the other team gains gold. This doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay. \\n\\n-Unlike other video game developers, Steam does not region lock. This brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference. You can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when there\\'s a Russian only speaker, Spanish only speaker and a Portuguese only speaker on the US WEST server. \\n\\n-Blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in America. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst aspect of the game. The game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future. More often than not, an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions.\\n\\n-There is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 10-20 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier.\\n\\n\\nThis review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary. Of course, if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person, be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy. \\n\\nFinal Rating: \\n-Game 9/10\\n-Game community 3/10',\n",

       "  'review': 'As a guy that started playing DotA1 back in 2006, take my words that you\\'ll only be able to enjoy this game if you totally dedicate yourself to learn and get better at it, in other words, you\\'ll need a lot of TIME to actually enjoy the game.\\n\\nDOTA2 is a very competitive game, where teamwork is everything, and unfortunately a lot of players don\\'t actually care or know about that, and thus making the game a rather difficult experience, especially for new players.\\n\\nNew player advice: Read as much as you can on the internet about DOTA2,watch videos, watch tournaments, get as much help as you can, starting fresh in a game that has an audience this big with a lot of experienced players is tough, since the majority of the players that will be on your team will expect you to know the game.\\n\\nAs a new player you would expect the game to put you in a team with other new players, right?\\n\\nWell DOTA2 system doesn\\'t work like that, even if you\\'re a new player, there\\'s still a chance that you\\'ll be put in a team with someone who has 2000hours in the game, this games evaluates you in WIN rate, and any new account has a rather high win rate, so it ends up putting you with very experienced players and you most likely won\\'t get in a bracket with ONLY new players.\\n\\nAs for playing the game, I would advise you to NEVER play SOLO ranked before actually knowing a huge part of the game, you can play NORMAL,TURBO or PARTY with your friends, but never actually try to get a SOLO rank, without knowing the game you\\'ll most likely get a very low rank and it\\'s really, really hard to climb from there, so don\\'t make this mistake.\\n\\nKeep in mind this game has a huge community and with that there\\'s a big part of it that consist in toxic players, so it\\'s very common for players in game to start a flame-war and ruin the experience, the best thing to do is open scoreboard and mute those people, this game needs you to be focused on the actual game rather than the people in the chat arguing with each other, even if it means muting all 4 of your teammates,you could also try to calm everyone down, but that almost never works out.\\n\\nBest advice for me is, try to be as POLITE as possible, even if you\\'re playing bad, try to get ideas/advices in-game from your teammates like \"What item should I get for my hero?\", saying \"My bad\" or \"Sorry\" everytime you do something wrong is also good, it makes people understand that you know you did something wrong and they might start helping you in-game.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably won’t suit you if you’re looking to play casually. \\nThere’s a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. \\nBut once you start to learn its secrets, there’s a wild and exciting variety of play here that’s unmatched, even by its peers. \\n\\nIt’s a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that it’s completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isn’t just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win.\\n\\n[spoiler]Reviewed by H4X0R[/spoiler]',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have around 1,500 hours on this game if you total in the hours on both my main account and alt, This is currently the main account I am using. I highly reccomend that if you play dota 2 be as non-toxic,friendly and supportive as you can. I have 100% won games just because I would thank my support and tell them how good of a job they are doing  or telling my ganker  or tank all the good things they are doing but the secret to winning is to be so nice that you can influence the people in your game to make good decisions like actually putting wards down so we dont get ganked and have vision or not going into that 1v5 just because you have resurrection up and feeding god dammit wraith king. Alot of people always say Dota 2 is a good game but the community is trash and just simply dont realize that they are also a part of the community and as part of the community it will become your job as i've realized is mine to be just simply a nice person, And I understand that there are these super toxic people and trolls and thats going to happen it's part of any game but that's what the mute button is for and if everybody would actually just try to be a nicer player those extremely toxic players would have a hell of a time being toxic if everyone on their team was complementing them if they did something good and just giving them advice. Dota 2 can be a great game where you can make lots of friends and have a good time or it can be a game where you log in everyday you scream and rage at the 4 other people that are suppose to be your teammates and have a horrible time, In the end it is up to you which path you will take. In short just be a nice dude and your positivity will spread, -Why can't everyone just be nice?\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Been playing Dota since early WC3, and I've gotta say, it's the first time I'm bothering to say a negative word generally and seriously about the state of the game. With removing side shops and functionally making the support role useless, since 5 farmed carries outweighs the value of someone who would previously fund support items (which are now free or pointless with map redesigns), even farming the uniquely powerful RNG items in the jungle alone with 1-2 people while others lane and fight is significantly more functional and valuable.\\n\\nThe game has lost its spirit and deteriorated to the state of its competitors after recently reaching an all-time high as a game and for gaming as a global, international community, with the recording setting and breaking TI this last August. I'm truly sad that a pastime and game I have had passion for in different forms for over 15 years, which I've followed in many stages and paradigms, is now resolving itself to things that sacrifice tactics, skill, and intelligence for gimmicks and RNG. After these last few matches I'll play for the sake of remembering what I used to love in the game, I'll be shelving it for the knowable future. Maybe Valve will come to their senses, but really, this isn't what any of us signed up for and supported DOTA+ to see. You don't take a standard and deteriorate it, the same way Coca-Cola hasn't started making Pepsi after they hit a global peak - they kept expanding beyond it by sticking to their defining product.\\n\\nDefine Dota as a standard Esport, the same as football or soccer or chess, and stop attempting to reinvent the wheel that was nearly perfect outside of tuning many years ago. Even CS has the same central gameplay after two decades. C'mon.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Dota 2 is the official sequel to the highly popular mod for Blizzard's Warcraft III, Defense of the Ancients. A mod that has been worked on by many, and therefore it was hard to determind where the rights belong. A lot of legal hocus pocus were going on between Blizzard and Valve last year, and it ended to valve's favor. The Dota name and franchise is now legally a part of Valve, probably thanks to the sneaky acquisition of IceFrog the year before.\\n\\nDota 2 is a real-time strategy game in the sub-genre called MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena). A genre that has grown rapidly the past few years, with different type of alterations in favor of success. Dota 2 is a close second to being the most popular MOBA, right behind the giant League of Legends. Just like LoL, Dota 2 is gaining success throughout it's competetive e-sport scene, and it's clear that valve is highly pushing it towards the first position. The latest and biggest tournament was The International 2013, which included a total prize pool of over 2.8 million US dollars, which was the biggest prize pool in e-sport history.\\n\\nGameplay is easy to understand but very hard to master. The map consists of 3 lanes that are constantly being pushed by NPC creeps. You are controlling a hero amongst 4 other in your team, and are fighting against 5 in the opposing team. The goal is to push your heroes and NPC creeps to the enemy base, where you have to destroy the ancient. It sounds pretty easy, but it requires hours upon hours to get a hold of the base mechanics, the more advanced mechanics and the professional mechanics. Plus the over 100 heroes you get to play and face.\\n\\nAfter 300 hours I have only touched what I call the more advanced mechanics, and I am not even close to professional level. The most experienced players have around 5000 hours of playtime and have spend the majority of their past 3 years to Dota 2. Since the game is Extremely competetive there will be a lot of curse words flying around while you play. These type of games are known for very hostile encounters with other players. There is an optional tutorial that you can take before going out there, beware though - the tutorial does not cover any Russian.\\n\\nDota 2 might be competetive, extremely enraging and the learning curve is steep as crap, but it is still the game that I have spend the most time playing on Steam (mostly because my collegues and bosses were playing it). Somehow I keep returning to it, so I suppose I am enjoying it. You better have people to play with though, and you better not be good friends - because this game will take your beloved friendship and wipe it's ass with it until you hate each other.\\n\\n[b]Only play this if you plan on getting some mental disorder. Time will fly, and you will realize you still suck and people hate you no matter what. It's free so why do you need a review anyway?[/b]\\n\\nTranslations: [url=http://steamcommunity.com//id/ragehulk/recommended/570/]German[/url]\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[i]I started playing this game back when it was a mod on warcraft 3, it was great then, the community was ayy ok, not so bad, a little toxic but not too toxic...as the years went by I moved out from my parents house and had less time to play the game I had become addicted to, the game I would spend my Friday and Saturday night doing whilst the normal kids were out getting drunk on there 18th birthday.\\n\\nAs a few years went back I began to realised that the cause of anxiety and depression are cured by playing this game but is also well known for causing it, so if you're depressed or feeling anxious, it's a 50 50 toss up as to whether you're going to get worse or not, do you like living life on the edge?\\n\\nThe game evolves around being the highest rank possible, at the most average of ranks you will get called trash and be flamed for being the same rank as your team mates.\\n[/i]\\n\\n[u][b]What is the community like you say?[/b][/u]\\n[i]Some would describe the community in terms like 'cancerous' and that's about the only word I've heard.[/i]\\n\\n[u][b]Favourite heard phrases?[/b][/u] - Spoiler contains harmful, be warned.\\n[spoiler][i]'Kill yourself' 'Hang yourself' etc, what more do you want?[/i][/spoiler]\\n\\nOther than that, I have been playing the game for over 10 years of my life and currently plan to continue, whilst I'm doing that, I'm intoxicating myself with alcohol and feeding it down mid, thanks for reading.\\n\\nGood luck out there, you'll need it.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This is the most rewarding, frustrating, entertaining, exhilarating, maddening, complex, and complicated game ever made. It never gets old, always changing with new and exciting variables with every new match. Every teammate will have strengths and weaknesses, every draft will change and morph to better or worsen your chances of victory. Every item selection or ability build will change your odds, but ultimately your understanding of timing and mechanics will gain you an exhilarating victory. And if you ever age out of playing or decide to be more casual, then Dota 2 has an esports scene that rivals IRL sports.\\n\\nPROS:\\nYou will gain friendships that will transcend the game.\\nYou will learn patience, forgiveness, and a deeper understanding of psychology.\\nYou will learn real world twitch reaction geometry, and trajectory mechanics.\\nYou will learn to calculate high level math in real time.\\nYou will learn how to communicate with people that have different personalities and ability.\\nYou will gain a better understanding of teamwork and synergy.\\nYou will have more fun in a 1 hour match then a 100 hour play through of any other game.\\nYou will save money, it\\'s Free to Play!\\n\\nCONS:\\nYour significant other wont understand that there is NO reasonable pause option.\\nYour current friends are probably too dumb or too busy to ever learn how to play.\\nYou will have to make new friends.\\nYou will have to manage your time or it will become an addiction.\\nYou will spend a ton of money it\\'s \"Free to Play\" not free to customize.\\nFinding Match times are high, and missing a queue is punishing.\\n\\n\\nAdditional thoughts:\\nThere is very little new player help, the game is so insanely complicated that new players will most likely give up or not try at all and eventually Dota 2 will be no more. The only real support comes from other players on reddit /r/DotA2 or youtube and most of the bug fixes and patches are because these communities complain so much the janitor at Valve will push a midnight update to keep reddit from burning down.\\n\\nWith that said, I am a 40 y/o business owner with 2 kids, a wife, and a huge family. I volunteer at a charity and work very long hours.... but when my work is done and the family is all tucked in I boot up Dotes and 5 stack with my boys to Defend the Ancient.\\n\\nDota 2 in my humble opinion is: The Greatest game ever made, period.',\n",

I didn\\'t quite know what exactly I would be getting myself into I just thought it was a new game and maybe I can enjoy it. Fast forward 24 hours later little did I know that I had actually sold my soul to ice frog with a free mod. Mind you, a F2P mod that utilized 110% of your brain to even make half decent plays and let alone get by with the shitty mapping.\\n\\nIt is now 2012 in my story and I was glad to see a beta key for DOTA 2 in my steam inventory. Again, little did I know what would actually come from the mistake of even launching the game. Similarly, just like the original DOTA a game that used 110% of your brain to even understand what your allies are even saying to you.\\n\\nIt is now 2019, I have grown as an individual refining my tastes in what I believe is \"quality\" content. AND LET ME FUCKING TELL YOU THIS GAME IS ACTUAL TRASH BECAUSE EVERY-TIME I QUEUE I HAVE THE INTERNATIONAL QUILT MAKING ASSOCIATION OF PLAYERS. \\n-YOU\\'VE GOT THE CHINESE GUY THAT CANT EVEN SEE HIS MONITOR AND PICKS PUDGE ONLY TO BRAG THAT A BLIND GUY CAN PLAY A SKILL SHOT HERO. \\n-YOU\\'VE GOT THE RUSSIAN GUY THAT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST NEGATIVE REMARK WILL TURN HIM BALLISTIC AND YOU HAVE TO HIDE UNDER YOUR DESK BECAUSE THE MISSILES ARE ALREADY ON YOUR WAY TO YOUR HOUSE.\\n -including an in game report-\\n-YOU\\'VE GOT THE FUCKING GUY FROM WHO KNOWS WHAT ISLAND THAT IS BUSY BANGING COCONUTS IN THE MICROPHONE SO YOU CAN\\'T EVEN DISTINGUISH IF HE\\'S TRYING TO COMMUNICATE MORSE CODE OR AN ACTUAL SPASTIC NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE GAME.\\n-YOU\\'VE GOT THE MID PLAYER FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM WHO THINKS HES ROYALTY ON THE KEYBOARD SERVING OUT 0-10 SCORES WITHIN 5 MINUTES IN THE MID LANE THEN BLAMING HIS TEAM FOR THE ENEMY TEAM BEING BETTER THAN HIM\\nAND FINALLY\\nTHE ONE YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR\\n-YOU\\'VE GOT ME, THE AMERICAN HOT HEAD WHO WILL LITERALLY SCREAM YOUR EAR OUT UNTIL YOU LOOK DOWN ON YOURSELF\\n\\nbut overall it\\'s a pretty lit game you should totally download it\\n',\n",

Very addicting game i put in like 34 hours in like 4 days! Never played a game so much in so little time before. Well, at least since Company of Heroes.\\n\\nHas nice simple graphics that run smooth. Any computer should be able to play this and have no real problem. That in itself makes the game more enjoyable.\\n\\nThere is a butt load of heroes to choose and play as. Like pokemon have to play them all. Would probably take days to do.\\n\\nThe only con i can think of. There is a lot of annoying people that constantly ping the map, and or complain the whole game.\\n\\n\\nOther then that. I recommend this game, most fun i had in awhile.',\n",

This game is so much more complex (which is daunting at first), but the more you learn and play the better it gets.

       "  'review': \"DotA 2 is a dog $hit game designed to rape the pleasure center of your brain in order to steal your time and money, and ultimately waste your life.  People will tell you that this is a deep and intricate game interwoven with layers of strategy, coordinated teamwork, and precise timing; it definitely can be in the 1% of games where your teammates aren't selfish toxic bastards or have lukewarm potato soup in place of a functioning brain. A huge majority of the player base is horribly racist and/or toxic and it has consistently been this way for years. Of course, the game is a much different experience if you play with a team made up of your friends, which most people who play Dota don't have (probably because they play Dota). Even then, you still run the risk of running into account boosters and smurfs which are pretty prevelant at the average skill level of the overall player base. \\n\\nWhile the community is probably one of the worst things about this game, the actual game itself has many significant problems too. One of my biggest gripes about Dota is that there are actually a lot of cool and fun features that should be included in the base game, but are locked behind paywalls (dota+, certain compendium features, etc.). With their most recent seasonal event, Valve has now introduced CSGO style cases into the game for DotA skins; I already hate everything about the CSGO model of microtransactions, which is essentially a worse version of gambling, and Valve just copy and pasted the system into Dota because they finally realized how dumb and easy manipulated the player base is. The business model around Dota 2 continues to become more greedy and exhortative with each passing day and will continue to do so. \\n\\n The gameplay itself can be good, fun, and addictive but is ultimately soured by everything else that surrounds it. Valve's attempts to update and expand the game throughout the past years have been pretty good, but (at least in my opinion) has failed to meaningfully improve on the core gameplay or enhance player experience. Overall, any time or money you were considering spending on this game would honestly be better spent on almost anything else, trust me your life will be better of for it.\\n\\nComing from someone who has spent an embarrassing amount of hours in this game, it is absolutely not worth it. I would be a much happier person if I could refund all the time and money spent on this heaping pile of garbage designed to suck your life away one minute and penny at a time.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I have played Dota 2 for a little over three years now, so I think I am finally ready to give it an in depth review. I gave this game a review back in 2013, but I am going to change that. First of all, I\\'m going to start by listing off what I like about the game.\\n\\n::THE PROS::\\n\\n1) Dota 2 is, obviously, a team game. Playing this game with friends is a really fun experience and can act as a source of really fantastic memories. My point is, if you play this game with a group of four other friends, Dota 2 is probably one of the best options out there.\\n\\n2) Dota 2 has a fantastic tutorial system and the game is very well designed to accomodate new players. A new player can go from a full AI game to an AI game with 4 other random people to playing a 5v5 online; the transition is really smooth.\\n\\n3) I have played both League and Dota, and I can honestly say that I think that Dota 2 is much more visually pleasing to look at. A smooth, clean UI makes the game easier on the eyes compared to League\\'s cartoon-y design (which suits some, but not me).\\n\\n4) Dota has an extremely vast pool of heroes that can be played to suit almost anyone\\'s playstyle. After you play Dota for awhile, you can pick out the heroes that really fit your playstyle and excel at them through ranked matchmaking. It\\'s damn near impossible to be bad at literally every hero. The large hero pool (100+) allows for THOUSANDS of different lineup possibilities, meaning every game has the chance to be completely new and different than anything you\\'ve played before.\\n\\n5) Honestly, Dota 2 is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. No; it is THE most addicting game I have ever played. As a full-time student, I still have managed to rack up 2,500 hours in this game in my free-time. Especially back when I was a new player, I played this game all the time.\\n\\nHowever. I am actually changing my review of this game from positive to negative. Let me tell you why.\\n\\n::THE CONS::\\n\\n1) Here\\'s my biggest flaw with the game. I absolutely hate -- I MEAN HATE -- Valve\\'s regional matchmaking. Before finding a match, the player is supposed to change server preferences to the closest server(s) to the members of the party, and they are supposed to choose the appropriate language preference. For example, as an American player, it is expected that you choose U.S. West and U.S. East as your servers, with English as your language preference. And, generally, Americans follow this rule. HOWEVER. In almost every game I play now, I get a Peruvian or Brazilian or someone from South East Asia in my games. Hopefully it makes sense to the readers of this review that you should not be finding a match in the United States if you live in Asia. You lag, and become actually useless in the game. The South Americans, though, spam in their native languages and constantly flame. Am I generalizing? Honestly, no. I\\'m really not. If you are good at Dota 2, you would and should queue for games for which you are prepared to play at your best. Valve has no form of region lock on matchmaking (they really can\\'t, due to international professional teams), and while it\\'s really not Valve\\'s fault, I just wish there was some way to reliably play with four people from your country and/or language. This is seriously Dota 2\\'s biggest flaw, because so much of every game revolves around the synergy and cooperation among teammates. This is literally impossible when someone spends the entire game flaming you in a different language. I\\'m honestly not trying to be discriminatory in any way; this is just how Dota is in reality and is likely never to change. I have become so fed up with this poor form of matchmaking that I have actually, finally, uninstalled the game.\\n\\n2) Dota has actually no reliable way to punish feeders. Sure, you and your team can use the report system (you only have a limited number of reports by the way, so after you expend them on flamers or feeders you are out of luck and have to enlist the other team and your teammates to waste their reports on the other feeders and flamers). The feeder may get put in low priority, but it honestly teaches them nothing. We have all been in low prio at one point or another, and we come out unchanged. Valve needs to implement a way to correct this. I\\'m not alone in my view on this either. Even professional player Secret.Puppey voiced his opinion the other day, which is very similar to mine. Punishments need to become more severe.\\n\\n3) The Dota 2 community is actually cancerous. If you are not playing in a 5-stack of friends, I can almost promise you that you will very rarely, if ever, get on a team where all 5 teammates are willing to cooperate and play as a coordinated team. Almost every single game, someone on your team will flame someone else for sucking really bad, mostly because they probably did. But people speak so hatefully towards one another that it really feels like an unwelcoming scene. One of the professional Dota casters (joinDota\\'s \"Capitalist\") tweeted the other day that he loses so much respect for pro players in pubs because they spend so much time flaming and tilting. This is actually about 90% of the Dota community, actually, not just the professionals. Everyone has this weird god complex where they are convinced they are better than everyone on the server, even if they got no kills and fed unimaginably badly.\\n\\n4) This kind of ties in with the points I have made previously. It is almost impossible to single-handedly win a game if your team is playing very poorly. Thus, the entire game comes down to teamwork; and most Dota players are unreliable teammates who will either feed or flame (90%, roughly, like I said). The 10% of people who don\\'t flame are the people who are actually in professional teams (and while they flame in pubs, they synergize well in their professional settings (unless you are kuro and rtz)).\\n\\n5) Dota is really bad for your health unless you have a godly amount of self control. If you win a game, you can end happy. But if you lose a game, you keep playing and keep losing and it becomes very depressing and frustrating. The garbage community gets in your head, and it\\'s just bad.\\n\\nLook, honestly, I fully expect to continue to follow the professional Dota scene. Dota really is one of the best games out there and it\\'s especially fun to watch the pros play. But, if you are looking for a MOBA that you can regularly enjoy, then you are better off playing StarCraft II, which is where I am headed now. Don\\'t get me wrong, though; Dota 2 is still much better than League of Legends and I would never suggest League of Legends to anyone unless they are really, really struggling with Dota 2. I won\\'t be returning to Dota until Valve makes some much needed changes to the game, or at least until I have had a long, much-needed break from the seriously draining community that Dota offers.\\n\\nTL;DR: It\\'s a good MOBA, better than LoL, but too many community & matchmaking issues to make this worth a positive. Gave me a great 3 years of entertainment though. Play SCII.\\n\\nRating: 7/10\\nGood game, for awhile. But community is horrible.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Dota 2 is one of the greatest team strategy games ever made. To detail in depth just what makes it so excellent would take a dozen pages at least. Suffice to say that the game is comprised of a multitude of mechanics, each of which is like it\\'s own \"mini-game\" within the larger game. What makes Dota a masterpiece is that it is so much more than the sum of it\\'s parts. The way that the individual elements fit together to make a single whole is simply extraordinary and the result of decades of refinement. \\n\\nHowever, while the game itself is nothing short of a masterpiece, the experience of playing it with others is often deeply unpleasant. It is fairly common for competitive online games to have a larger than average portion of toxic players. However, nothing comes close to Dota, both in the quantity of toxic players and the degree to which they can negatively impact your experience playing the game. In Dota, one toxic player can easily doom an entire team. As a result of this power, toxic players can effectively hold teams hostage, forcing them to capitulate to their demands or face a 40+ minute miserable experience. Toxic players can be muted, but Dota requires all five players to cooperate, so muting someone generally results in a four man team, which severely diminshes one\\'s chance of winning.\\n\\nThe scariest part of all of this is that the last time I checked, I had a near perfect behavior rating, which means that on average, I was matched with \"better behaved\" players. Furthermore, I have a fairly tough skin, and am used to online flaming. Nonetheless, I would estimate that at least 20% of my matches were ruined by toxic players: not because they played poorly, but because of their communications and behavior. I played Dota constantly for years and I never once lost my love for the game itself. But eventually, the behavior of the players made me give up. Winning a match was as much about managing the emotions of your teammates as they were about playing well.\\n\\nThe reason that I am recommending Dota is that there is one easy way to avoid this toxicity: play with friends! When you have a team of people working together, there are few, if any games, that can match the experience. Everyone has an essential role to play, and everyone can find their unique niche. This is the way the game is intended to be played and I truly cannot overstate just how fun it is.\\n\\nThe bottom line: Dota is a masterpiece that only shines when playing with a cooperative team. Solo play just isn\\'t viable long term for anyone but the most patient and devoted.',\n",

       "  'review': '    I could tell that i deeply love this game, and hope you guys love it same as me.\\n    For the C-incident, it\\'s obvious that racism is a huge and intolerable mistake, however, many of the Chinese using this rating page or other forums addressing their anger, in a way of racism and insulting others families. They called the Russian \"maozi\"(insulting with their hairy bodies), the Caucasian \"baipizhu\" or white *** pigs(insulting with skin color), the Japanese \"guizi\"(insulting as they are ghosts), and the Southeast Asian \"houzi\"(insulting as they are monkeys). And that same racism is intolerable to me and to everyone!!!!!!! If you are asking for respecting, you have to respect others and respect yourself first.  They supposed that Valve should be responsible for this incident and abused every other race. They tried to threaten Valve through massive negative comments (like refusing to use steam or giving up Dota2), and after Valve released their announcement, they were not satisfied with it and kept complaining. That literally looks like a baby rage. \\n    I\\'m a Chinese myself, and I\\'ve addressed my view on racism and abusing in some Chinese forum, and got attacked by those Chinese haters as well. Actually, I believe that most of us aim at the same game(except these god damn haters), we all want to build a friendly, equal and anti-racism community, and we all love this game. \\n    For those who made trouble, I could tell that they deserve it. But for the rest, we also deserve a better community. I hope Valve could clarify their guide lines and rules of the rating system and may possibly deleted these raged comments. \\n   Let\\'s leave these haters and enjoy some Dota !\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                         Parren\\n\\n   [spoiler] Come on 7.20 I know you are coming.

       "  'review': \"Dota 2 is a very highly skilled game, don't expect to walk in and expect you being very good. You are going to die alot and probably yell at your team mates but that's just the nature of this game. Dota 2 takes place in an arena where you will fight to destory the enemies Anicent if you destory it; you win.\\n\\nThe Ancient is protected by 11 stuctures called towers that protect it. Each of these towers are found in each of the three lanes bottom, middle and top. You take control of a unit that is a hero, many of them are diverse and have a lot of pros and cons such as Crystal Maiden who is really good at locking down heros early game with her stun but she is also the slowest hero in the game. \\n\\nYou are accompanied by 4 other players including yourself to fight against another 5 players. You need to push lanes to be able to destory the enemy towers in each lane but the catch is the enemy team is doing the same thing, so you need to not only push to your victory but to stop the enemy team from pushing aswell. \\n\\nThere is 107 heros in Dota 2 out of the 112 heroes that are in the Warcraft III. They are categorised into 3 groups. Strenght, which are usually the tanky guys. Agility, most carries are found in this category and Intelligence which most of the supports are usually found. All these heroes have different skill levels, such as Invoker who is an intelligence hero with 14 spells. He is able to create spells with 4 of his spells, creating the other 10. He is able to create tornados which disable enemies, meteors which looks epic and burns enemies that stand in front of it. Just an all round crazy hero. Viper is arguably the easiest hero which as 2 passive spells (Passive spells are spells that work all the time, you don't need to activate them) and 2 other spells which are targetable.\\n\\nYou can customise your Dota experience with annoucer packs which change the voice of the annoucer which include Glados and the narrator from the Stanley Parable. You can change your HUD to different themes. \\n\\nThe game allows you to buy tickets where you can support tournments, some of these tournments allowing you to directly contribute to the prize pool. Most of the time it is 25%. In 2014, The International is a annual tournment created by Valve for Dota 2. In 2014, the prize pool for this tournment became 10.9M dollars. First place got 5M dollars! If you are into ESports then this game will be up your ally.  \\nDota 2 is a hard game, but if you look in the right places you are able to learn a lot, if you aren't sure you want to play this game, you can PM me and I can teach you how to play. I honestly don't mind. \\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Dota 2 ranks among few titles that can be classified as truly free-to-play.  While many other titles label themselves with this distinction, there are often convenience purchases or some form of power available for real money transactions.  While Dota 2 has an extensive cash shop, all offerings are completely cosmetic.  HUD options, voice packs and character costumes form the basis of a store lacking even an iota of power or convenience for purchase.  All gameplay elements are absolutely free and do not require collection or usage of any kind of in-game currency.\\n\\nOnce a player has determined that they’re ready to commit to a steep learning curve and potential negative interactions with teammates (Again, learn with friends to reduce this aspect), Dota 2 is incredibly enjoyable and possibly one of the best multiplayer games ever made.  Every match is different, and watching perfect team fight execution is gaming art.  Players have access to a huge range of hero styles and the interactions between teammates and foes are incredibly diverse.  It’s twenty to forty-five minutes of gladiatorial bliss, the end result carefully orchestrated from the first enemy tap to the final crushing blow.\\n\\nDota 2 can be experienced and enjoyed at multiple levels of engagement, and it’s a title that rewards users for a deep dive.  Heavy investment, heavy reward.  The barrier to entry isn’t quite as bad as it was years ago, but it would be disingenuous to say that the game doesn’t have a colossal learning curve.  As a free-to-play title readily available on Steam, it offers players a frictionless doorway – but the challenge may be keeping new players interested and willing to commit to the epic journey that is learning, playing, and enjoying Dota 2.\\n\\nThe game is in a strong place right now. It’s rewarding and sociable like few other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. The next few months will be crucial: it’s currently the best expression of Valve’s progressive attitude towards players, and if it can continue on that track it describes a future for online gaming that is far more hopeful than the one we’re used to.\\n\\nJust remember to spend your starting cash, and make sure someone buys the courier. Oh, and when Riki starts showing up in your games, just get some Sentry Wards down and don't run away. Also, you always want a Bottle when in mid-lane, and runes spawn at 0:00 and again every two minutes. Practice last-hitting before you go online. And if you're jungling, memorise where the low-level Creeps are.\\n\\nActually, you know what? Forget all that. Just have fun.\\n\\n4 out of 5\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Dota 2 is a game that requires practice, patience and a positive attitude to succeed. While the basic fundamental principles of the game remain unchanged from its earliest incarnation, the meta and dynamic is constantly and ever-changing. Of all the major RTS/MOBA games on the market, Dota 2 provides the most challenging, in depth and unique experience.\\n\\nIf you dream of \"going pro\" then Dota 2 is a game where anyone can become an e-sports legend if they\\'ve got the skill to back it up. Major tournaments including the annual International tournament have open qualifiers with no rank/MMR requirement. All you have to do is beat the competition.\\n\\nDota 2 matches can get spicy. Don\\'t get caught up in the negativity, mom-bashing and cancer-wishing. While you\\'re angrily banging away at your keyboard, the other team is winning. Also, Dota 2 isn\\'t a game that holds your hand. I recommend reading Purge\\'s Welcome to Dota, you suck[purgegamers.true.io] for all new players. You can also check out this Dota 2 Quickstart Guide on Steam.\\n\\nWarning: If your free time consists of constantly raging that everyone else is ruining your life because you lost a game or claiming that you\\'re being persecuted just because you called a *few* people a \"♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥\" then you should uninstall immediately.',\n",

You\\'re going to watch videos of pro people teaching you how to play, and you\\'re going to think that now you\\'re really good.\\nYou\\'re wrong.\\nOver time, however, things will get better, and you\\'ll actually start winning. Then, you start losing again, but this time it\\'s not your fault; it\\'s your teams fault. Always remember that NOTHING is EVER your fault. Your dumbass anti-mage was complaining that you were stealing his farm, but it\\'s your farm dammit! Then pudge is getting butthurt about losing lane because he never had a flying courier, when the real reason he lost is because he didn\\'t give you unit control when you are clearly a better pudge! Meanwhile the enemy team is getting fed because your teamates never backed you up when you blitzkrieged in 1v5, and they even have the nerve to question your methods! Then you notice that your dumbass anti-mage is in the jungle farming because \"he couldn\\'t farm in lane.\" You know, however, that he is just a noob.\\nEventually the enemy is pushing your tier 3s, and the game is obviously over. This is the time when you give up and sit in base. Ignore the fact that your team has won the last two teamfights and you are starting to catch up, it\\'s better if you just quit now. While you\\'re waiting in base, make sure that the enemy team knows that you are not at fault in your loss. Make sure you type in all-chat \"team noob\" followed up by \"report anti-mage.\" If they ask why you want them to report him, ignore them, if your team has the bodacity to try and defend themseves, repeatedly say phrases such as \"lol ur so bad\" and \"ur just mad cuz you cant play.\" You could also take the alternative route and say things like \"им незрелые восьмилетний\" and \"я должен убить себя.\"\\n\\nYea, the game and communtiy can be a cyka sometimes, but it\\'s also a super fun game that requires fast paced decision making as well as strategical analysis. Plus, it unifies gamers and conservatives by creating one common hatred: Russians.\\n\\nAll in all, this game is 90% getting pissed, and 10% feeling like you\\'re on top of the world, but that 10% makes you feel sooooo good that it keeps pulling you back.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Dota 2, what is it about games that makes you hate? So many hours wasted on this abusive arsehole that keeps on spitting you in the eye like you were a footballer’s wife. And yet you keep coming back for more, like the stupid machisitic moron you are.\\n\\nSee, this game hates you. It is pure, binary-evil that gives everything up-front and reaps the poor fools that puts their life-time on the line like a greedy whaler. I have learned new forms of hatred for both mankind, Russians, my friends and myself simply for playing it! I am by no means a stable person without Dota 2, but with it I could transform a purist choirboy into a raving satanist without even blinking. Everyone that says this game isn’t out to get you is either a fat liar or a full-fledged delusionist. And once you invite the devil across the threshold to your desktop it is there to stay, weighing down your hard-drive like an elephant-man covered in cheap cosmetics and battle-pass levels. \\n\\nI have to commend Valve for its genius. The Dota 2 window-dressing of plethoric proportions contains colorful characters, incredible cosmetics, and interesting lore in one neat package for everyone to enjoy. Only behind the curtain lies a pile of massacred dreams, crushed hope and cargo-ship’s worth of harvested tears that feeds the cyber-entity that is Dota. This game is not for the faint of heart. This might be the best horror game I have ever had the misfortune of playing. \\n\\nStay the living hells away from this game. I rue the day when I invited this daedric she-devil into my life. Because just like SCP-106 there is no going back once this malevolent keter-class MOBA sucker-punches your innocence and drags you into its dark place.',\n",

We are hopeful that Windranger arcana and Immortal Treasure 3 will be coming within the next couple weeks or so, with Windranger coming out first,” the developer stated.\\n\\nI have watched more than ten clips on Youtube if popple openning quantity of (10 to 100) and nothing but tire one and two scam, why we cannot read the precentering of us having items just like we always did did since TI7 , or this is the smart new move toward more scam behind fininding the chest in gameplay, but buying the key from the Vavle for so much ofcourse we are NOT allowed to qustion, we just pay and get scammed ! \\n\\nWhomever cameup with this in Valve is the Devil, but still an so direct and so agressive move that make us understand the sitauation, thank you for the headsup my man, I am out, and for the rest of you, my borthers and sisters dont allow this.\\n\\nJust leave, you will be betteroff without this game.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I have been playing DOTA for a long time now and have been following the pro scene watching tournaments left and right whenever they are broadcasted, know the teams/players to the point I understand every meme there is about them and absolutely love that part of this game. But this review is going to talk about my personal negative experience as a player whose played the matchmaking and the community that you will experience and to warn new players of what they may experience themselves if they decide to try this game.\\n\\nSo after pouring a huge chunk of my life into this game, I have decided to finally quit and move on with my life. \\n\\nI have neglected real life responsiblities because of this game (spending time with my wife and kid). I have also wasted time on this game that I could have spent playing many, many other games that are in my steam library that have basically rotted for the past 4 years.\\n\\nAlmost every match I have played left me with some sort of rage inside or anger that I couldn't let go of until I started another match and sometimes that match that follows would continue until I have a winning match. To be honest though the rage and anger definintely outweighs the happiness and slight adrenaline rush from winning a match. \\n\\nI would not recommend this game to someone new who is wanting to start into MOBAS or even looking to start a new game. It has sucked many hours from my life that I farily regret spending, as well as money that I spent on cosmetic/skins. This money and time could have been spent on family matters or bills, something that is 100% more important than a game. Although money isn't neccesarry to play the game to the fullest, it is just something that will taunt you when playing; seeing the shiny skins for heroes on your homepage and sales for items can be alitte tempting at times.\\n\\nSomething else that you see people mentioning in reviews is that the community is absolutely toxic, which is entirely true. Almost every match you will run into rage filled people that will say anything and everything to make you feel terrible about your self which in turn makes you play worse, even if you aren't neccesarily playing that bad.\\n\\nI will say though the games mechanics and design is very well done and is very enjoyable for the most part, just everything else mentioned in my review kind of outweighs it.\\n\\nI want to say goodbye to DOTA 2 once and for all.  Finally I can continue on with my life as a normal person.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The Player base of Dota 2 has been going down consecutively for 5 months. All the legacy players that have grown up playing this game are leaving the game. Valve doesnt show any intention of improving the game and even has limited communication and support to the pro-scene. This can also be seen in fan favourite games such as team fortress 2. Which is almost irrelevant now adays compared to other newer fps games. Comparative to other games such as Leauge of legends. the promotional material and content effort put in the game is limited. Such as a campaign to help new players join the game. Many systems put in place does not work. such as the guild system does not promote communication and bonding of the community. And the dota PLUS feature is nothing much more then getting exclusive skins. The match making algorithm is also flawed trying to push everyones winrate to 50% creates situations where u have team mates with low winrate after ur win rate goes up for a while. Other then that, the toxicity especially in SEA servers hasnt been addressed as the reports and commends system has limited affect as people use it casually and u get reported if ur on a losing streak even if u didnt not flame anyone afk and such. The custom game community also suffers as every update breaks their content unlike the days of warcraft 3 custom games. After almost 10 thousand hours on this game it sad to say but Dota has lost its flame and with it my Passion for it as i close off this page of my life.',\n",

       "  'review': 'At this point in time, I\\'ve wasted round 3-5 years of my life playing this game.\\n\\nIt\\'s a small amount compared to the hours that my peers and teammates have amassed, even I, who had started when beta was released to the general public. A good chunk of the gaming population has played it at least once, or have heard of it, or am still playing even as type this review out.\\n\\nAnywho, let\\'s talk about Dota.\\n\\nDota 2 is not a game; it\\'s a major time sink. You spend the first 100-200 games improving your gameplay to be even called \"below average\", whilst losing horribly in every single one. You will weep. Burst in an outrage. Asking yourself why did you ever choose to play this game in the first place.\\n\\nEvery single game roughly consists of 40-50 mins that you give all your efforts to be returned with a fleeting feeling of joy. Bliss. Or the soul crushing depression of losing the past 10 games during the weekend - the times you turned down your friends at a night out to play this game.\\n\\nIt\\'s not because Dota is hard. No, no. It\\'s not the mechanics that you have fine-tuned yourself in being able to do over and over a 100 times without messing up. \\n\\nIn my words, it could very well be as easy as playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure or as ball crushing hard as playing Dark Souls with no proper equipment - simply because the game boils down to one thing:\\n\\nTeamwork. Synergy between people, how they cooperate, willingly or not. More often at times you\\'re going to have the most disillusioned people with a lexicon of a drunk jaded middle-aged man who\\'s going through a mid life crisis rather than the quiet, reserved player who tries his/her best in assisting your efforts in a win.\\n\\nIt can be argued that the game can be won single-handedly by a skilled player, but it\\'s a pipe dream to seek that out, for most of the general population - but it does not deter them from doing so, which leads to yet another problem/frustration within the game. \\n\\nPeople seek glory within it; they yearn the temporary recognition it brings, and those players put their teammates beneath them, which ultimately loses them the game. \\n\\nIn short there are a lot of different reasons and expectations of the game, which may cause conflicts ultimately losing you the game. Save yourself the trouble and do something else.\\n\\nEdit -  For those of you who cant math for some reason, 4k hours over 4 years is roughly 3 games a day assuming its a game is an hour on average.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This review is totally honest. I spent hours upon hours on this game. It was a horrific and quite a sad journey to reach the \"not bad\" skill bracket. Everything in this game, from the toxic community to the rage I have had to endure for this game was difficult and nearly impossible for me to accomplish but i did. After the 1500 hours, I questioned myself, what did I do this for? The fame and money or the fact that the game is so addicting that I chose to play 10 hours of DOTA 2 before my exam. (The result was an E grade which is not bad...Is it??). Could it be that I watched TI6 and TI7 and was inspired to make my mark on the aegis of champions. Whatever the reason, my family despised me for what i had become.\\n In short: DOTA 2 is a game which is not free to play. It requires you to sell your soul to the devil (Valve) and leave your current life for you to become a legend',\n",

       "  'review': \"Just like real-time chess, but everyone is a queen. Some queens shoot lasers, some summon huge Golems and some sing so hard your eardrums burst. Dota 2 is definitely one of the best games of this generation, and I'm certain it will remain as popular and as influnencal for many years to come.\\n\\nGraphics: 8.5/10\\nVery pretty, the art direction in DotA 2 is one of the best. The source engine ensures you can run it on anything more powerful than a toaster, and have it look great too. Cosmetics look great, and fit perfectly, with some exceptions,(I'm looking at you Alpine Ursa) but many stay true to the heros artstyle. \\n\\nSound: 9.5/10\\nAll heros have a multitude of voice lines,and some even respond to one another (e.g Tidehunters hatred for Kunnka). If you find the default anouncer not too flash, theres a huge variety of optional packs, from the smoth talking Narrator from bastion, to the harsh condescending tone of Pyrion Flax. \\n\\nGameplay: 10/10\\nThe big one. Theres a reason DotA Allstars got so popular, not just from the incredible passsion from the community, or the dedication of IceFrog and co., but from the incredible gameplay that spawned one of gamings most popular genres. From perfectly co-ordinating a fountain hook, to getting stuck on top of a cliff accidentally as Storm Spirit, no other genre rivals DotA 2 outstanding strategic gameplay and near-vertical learning curve. At the time of writing, I have 7,469 hours played and I've only just scratched the surface in the combos, stratagy and 107 availble heros to use, it takes year of hard work, dedication and passion to become truly great at the strategical masterpeice that is Dota 2.\\n\\n- beardATTACK @ fren\",\n",

I\\'ve been playing Dota 2 for around 10 years since it was DotA, the Warcraft III custom map and I\\'ll tell you right now there\\'s still a lot of room for personal improvement. This game boils down to far more than individual skill, tactics, and teamwork/cooperation. The author of \"Three Lane Highway\" (see pcgamer.com) has called Dota an \"isometric wizard-em up\" game, and I think it\\'s fitting. There are so many aspects to this game, so many factors that control the outcome that if you try and sit down and list them all it\\'ll take you a couple hours. And you\\'ll still miss some. I have played pretty much every single \"Multi-player Online Battle Arena\" on the market, and no matter how interesting they are or what different elements they try to bring to the gameplay, I always end up coming back to Dota. \\n\\nIf you want to seriously challenge yourself, and you have the will and motivation to work towards a lofty goal that many are unable to reach, this is the game for you.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have been a gamer for my whole life, but I never really put a ton of time into any one game. In the early 2000s, when I had a lot of free time, Quake 3, Elite Force, Jedi Knight 2, et cetra all took up a ton of my time; but as my age progressed, I had less time to dedicate to gaming. Mass Effect 1 and 2 both took about 100 hours away from me; but that was probably the most I'd invested in many years.\\n\\nI currently have around 500 hours of Dota 2, and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. The gameplay is spectacular, the community is great (I have made more Steam friends on this game than any other), the meta is interesting, the professional scene is a blast to watch, and the game is extremely well supported - especially with the recent Wraith Night/Legion Commander content update. \\n\\nThe thing is that I'm not great at Dota 2. I've put almost 500 hours in, and there's still more for me to learn - there are still some heroes I have yet to play! It is a lot of investment, but once you 'get' it, you will have an absolute blast.\\n\\nEDIT: Just updating this now that I've put around 1600 hours in.\\n\\nI still completely stand by everything that I said previously. The game is super fun, and I'm really enjoying playing with all of the friends I've made in it. I've also experienced some of the negative parts of the community, and they're unfortunate; but I must say that they are far and few between. The community is largely welcoming, and I've made some fantastic friends through it - ones I hang out with in real life now.\\n\\nDefinitely play the game, the learning curve is steep but entirely worth it.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'A great game with a very friendly and tolerant community, its also a very educational and cultural experience. Since I\\'ve been playing dota I\\'ve learned to speak russian and spanish, Who needs rosetta stone when you have dota right? The russians are so friendly and have a neat little nickname for americans called \"Suukah\", I think it means comrade or friend. And the peruvians are so helpful, for instance I was mid as pudge and at the start of the match a peruvian dazzle came mid with me and stayed with for about 11 minutes, He helped me out by taking the last hits and first blood. He said \"movimiento puta\", I think it means \"I got your back\", What a nice guy. Dota is great and all but there are a few problems with some heros, like bloodseeker, Phantom Assassin, Faceless void, And huskar. They need to be buffed, I find them extrememly underwhelmed. Bloodseekers ult cd is just too long and needs to be lowered to ten seconds, Phantom assassin needs a higher crit ratio, faceless needs more evasion and movement speed, and huskar\\'s flaming spear should cost no hp. Oh and there\\'s one other hero needs to be nerfed hard, Bat rider is just too overpowered and unbalanced. I think he has too much hp, and the base should be lowered to 320, also lower his base movement speed to 200. Aside from those few problems dota 2 is the best FPS I have ever played in my life.',\n",

Would I be a happier or a sadder man than I am now? What is certain is that of all the games I have played, I have spent more time with none other than you. For those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about, let me introduce you to Dota 2, Valve's faithful sequel to a game that can most easily be described to the uninitiated as a mix between the RTS and RPG genres. The game consists of two 5-man teams with each player choosing a unique hero and fighting to destroy the opposing team's throne. It sounds simple enough, but once you mix in the seemingly myriad number of heroes to choose from, the race to level up faster than your opponents, and the vast array of items to buy, you have one of the deepest and most competitive games on the planet.\",\n",

After just a few minutes of playing this game, I realized how much of a piece of shit this game is. This game wasted soo much of my god damn time in a lovely way. It has given me lots of mental issues including severe anxiety of the real world. I accidently  stopped doing heroin and other drugs i was addicted to because of this game and i will never find that pleasure again! instead i replaced one good drug with a worse drug, DotA 2. There is nothing better than spawning in treants as natures prophet and backdooring towers. It's a sick pleasure. I am disgusted with my dirty rat ways but i just receive soo much dopamine that i cant get off playing! This is better than jerking off. I've started skipping my 4th year in business because i felt like Natures Prophet teaches me everything i need in the business world with the strats of getting gold. Thank you for listening to whatever the fuck this is.\",\n",

A game that will suck you in with temporary overdose of dopamine that will reward you with absolutely fucking nothin and before you know it you spend thousands of hours decaying in this pile of shitbag. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong, the game in itself is beyond amazing.However the community is some fucked up shit, Players who start feeding with their heroes or couriers just because you accidentally took their last hit, and theres nothing you can fucking do about it except using your fucking puny 3 reports which will literally do nothing. Players who spam ping you for every small mistake you make. Rats that will insult you on a personal level as following\\n\\nNever ever in a game will you find a community as toxic as dota. Too many unchecked slum rats with extra chromosomes resulting from 6 Generations of inbreeding. Guaranteed trashtalking in 90% of games if youre in the trash tier like myself.  \\nThis game will turn you into a racist scumbag who has banged everyones mother or be the victim of having your mom banged by everyone\\nIn the end you'll wonder how your kidney is still functioning with all the salt, and wonder if those thousands of hours you played was worth it. You'll question your life choices, you'll question your very own existence, and feel like starting your own genocide against a whole race because of all the A Holes you meet in your games.\\n\\nIt was fun while it lasted. Just dont get to it, please.. Its not worth your time\",\n",

       "  'review': 'In-depth, competitive, scientifically proven, approved by Church of England and American Monster Truck foundation,\\ntrue MLG review on award-winning game: Heroes of League Of Autists 2.\\n\\nAlright, guys, listen. My name is [IG] D[andi] SingSing aka WildPussyDigger1998UA and i will throw some of my wild gameplay suggestions in a game that is totally not corrupted by trends, pro leagues where people play like lobsters on acid (denying your own aegis because you click like a frenzied ape when nothing around is happening) and totally not toxic community where every Ivan, George and PingPongClingClong is a distinguished pro gamer with 200 years of  training at Icefrog\\'s monastery of enlightement somewhere inbetween Tibet\\'s asscheeks.\\n\\nOkay, let\\'s go: This riding on cat Mirana chick with face that looks like she just seen a dolphin putting on a condom. Her ultimate allows teammates to get invisibility for given time. Which can, for instance, save your carry+ support who is getting dived by frenzied Bristleback and enemy mid hero with 2 runes up his butt. So just press r - and since they didnt have any dusts - your carry is safe. Haha, no! We can\\'t have any of that! I need more damage on my arrow that i will miss anyway. Plus if my allies are dying, i can just blame them instead of doing anything. If they are russians - just double your blame output.\\n\\nOkay, so we have that hero, Spector, but it doesnt look like this gay guy from Bioware game. So she has ability to move through obstacles and units, has free tons of pure damage (can\\'t be reduced by armor) on every illusion, and map presense with her ultimate that allows her to fight at any given time without leaving her farming spots until necessary, and with high enough agility her illusions can just inflict enough damage so your team can fight freely while you patiently taking your farm. SO WHAT DO WE DO? OF COURSE WE AINT GONNA DO ANY OF THAT: we will get her phase boots because spectral dagger is clearly not enough, we will never ever get free damage on carry, and we get a bloody skill that blocks and returns damage instead (when enemy team has like. ugh, same damage output as yours?and you have no hp yet anyway?). Get vanguard that just doesn\\'t work because of dota 2\\'s RNG programming and then will farm radiance till 50\\' timemark because expensive aura with item\\'s green damage that doesnt work on illusions (even though aura does work and can do a lot of good things, like blocking enemy\\'s blink dagger that will be blocked by your ult in a second anyway) is clearly better than stat-gain or mana-burn.\\n\\nOkay, so we have that orange bird guy, that can hold solo lane against 2 or 3 people with minimum deaths (except some specific combos that just screw up his escape) and set of abilities that allows to eviscerate enemy team if your allies have at least ANYTHING to hold them in place. What are we gonna do with this hero, you may ask. Of course we will put him on a support role and make him buy mekansm, so he would never have any mana for his high damage dots that also have ridicilous slow debuff and ult that is easily countered only like by ten heroes out of 150. We have Mirana without ultimate to go get all this exp, remember?\\n\\nAlright, these situations are obviously too situative, so we will talk about global scale meta:\\nLet\\'s get to most obvious question: what hero should we pick? The answer is - PUDGE.\\nYou need mid - you pick PUDGE. You need support - you pick PUDGE. You need offlane, jungler, roamer, carry, social worker, girlfriend, president of the united states of \\'Murrica? - Just pick Pudge. Why? Because someone did that on twitch.tv, you silly noob cheekyscrublord.\\n You, of course, have same skill as pro players so you can just mimic them and game will be magically won! You don\\'t need to think about anything, just buy recommended items and blame your teammates if something is wrong. You got a motherflipping DRAGONCLAW HOOK afterall. If you bought an item that is worth of 3 years of your school lunchboxes - nobody will have enough guts to argue with your divine skill in pressing q button at cursor location to lasthit a creep (mute everyone at the start of the game just in case tho).\\n\\nNext important issue is map presense, lane control, creep control, ability to analyze situation, counter-warding and all that important elements of this pseudo-strategical [strike]map[/strike] game. For all of that just remember these two lines:\\n\"BUY WARDS\"\\n\"WHERE THE GANG\" (it is important that you will never type \"gank\" properly).\\n\\nThis is basically all you need to know about this game. Remember: its not important to win! It\\'s the whole competetive spirit and sportsmanship that matters! Everyone has around 50% winrate anyway because of matchmaking, and ELO system in rankeds is based on wizard-science and tarot-fortunetelling (it\\'s supposed to work only in chess anyway). Yeah, developers may tell you their rating system is not based on elo, but can Volvo really pull off their own mathematic rating model for the game that after all these years still lags when someone is picking a hero, armor rating still doesnt work properly, and hero with 320 movespeed can chase down and kill hero with 350 because of model animation? Oooh i think not.\\n\\nAnyway i give this game 100 dirty apes out of 100 and encourage you to start playing as fast as possible, to join in most viral addiction the world ever saw since taking heroin rectally, poping polyethylene packages or throwing water filled condoms out of the window became a thing.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Dota 2 is quickly becoming the most played game on Steam, and for good reason. The blend of well-balanced multiplayer, infinite replayability, gorgeous aesthetics, and the time and care Valve has put in to support the community is a recipe for perfection. I simply cannot reccomend Dota 2 enough.\\n\\nThe game boasts a roster of over a hundred heroes, and each one feels unique and well-designed. In any given match, you take control of a singular hero, and victory or defeat hinges not only on how well you play that hero, but how also on how well you synergize with your five person team.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the barrier of entry is high. Quite a lot of research, preparation, and knowledge is required to be sucessful, and it can be frustrating losing repeatedly. However, tutorials are available to guide new players, and the time spent learning only adds to the satisfaction of landing a five-man Black Hole or pulling off that perfect Blink-Poof combo.\\n\\nSpectacularly enough, the battlefield is not the only area where the game shines. Dota TV is an in-game spectator mode that allows the option to watch professional teams play in tournaments, including the multi-million dollar International that Valve hosts on a yearly basis.\\n\\nAnd all of this for free. There are cosmetic items that can be used to customize your favorite hero, however nothing availble changes gameplay in any way. They are mostly designed by members of the community and can be purchased or recieved randomly while playing.\\n\\nContent patches and new heroes are being added all the time. Dota 2 will continue to grow for years, hopefully continuing to find new players interested in a fast-paced online multiplayer experience that is equal parts exhilirating and engaging.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'Dota 2 is one of if not the most frustrating and aggravating game ever created. Your teammates will cater the enemy team, not back you up, and refuse to call missings or place wards. The enemy team will always pick combos or retarded heroes that will make you want to immediately leave the game while your teammates pick 4 carrys after you randomed Phantom Assassin and tell you to buy the wards. Every other game you will get a Russian Pudge picker that feeds 3 kills mid in 5 minutes and immediately ruins all the work you\\'ve done last hitting every creep and harassing the enemy out of lane. You\\'ll rage and call \"GG\" early and trash talk your teammates but you\\'ll still keep playing in hope that the game will turn around. As things start to finally look good, you get bashed 5 times in a row by a faceless void or the Ogre Magi will get a 4x multi-cast on you 2 times in a row while the Nature\\'s prophet is pushing your top barracks. \\n\\nBut after all the rage inducing pain, you keep playing. You suffer through it for the chance of that amazing, satisfying comeback even though you\\'re 20,000 gold behind the enemy team. Only to have your dreams crushed when the enemy team finally kills your ancient. But you still keep playing due to the feeling you get when you get that rampage that allows you to push to victory. Even so, after the game you\\'ll still rage because of the common chest you get as a reward for your 60 minutes of pain and suffering. When you finally get that mythical you\\'ve always wanted, valve will come out with an event that lowers the price and makes it almost worthless. \\n\\nIt\\'s a drug that once hooked to, is almost impossible to break. You almost don\\'t even realize you\\'re raging and forget that you\\'re telling your best friend how much of a feeding faggot he is and how this lost game is because of him when you\\'re the one who has 1 kill and 13 deaths.\\n\\nYou keep playing in hope that you\\'ll get good enough where you\\'ll be able to play with Dendi or the other pros and you know that\\'ll most likely never happen but you keep playing in hope of it happening one day.\\n\\nI would not wish this addiction on my worst enemy. But I can\\'t stop you, nor can I stop playing myself.',\n",

If you are a competetive person, enjoy breaking your limits and achieving goals - don\\'t even think of installing this game. JUST DON\\'T FUCKING DO IT.\\nTry learning how to play guitar, salsa dancing, Java programming, anything. But not DOTA. Because after 3-4 years of playing and more than 4k matches you wiil feel the same shit I feel now. It is regret. You will regret all that time you wasted on a computer game that gave you nothing back. Don\\'t get me wrong, this is a great game. It is perfectly designed, it provides an incredibly wide range of emotions. BUT! You will eventually understand, that you could have used all that precious time to make yourself a better human being and already conquire this goddamn world. Instead of hitting creeps, destroying towers and raging on teammates.\\nYou might think of e-sport at some point. But game is not worth the candle. Just sit down and calculate chances yourself if you are seriously considering earning money playing it.\\nIf you just want to chill at weekends with friends playing a few matches - go for it, this is a great way to do it. But if I were you I would go to a nearby bar and find a good company and some adventures instead, it is far more interesting and profitable.\\nNot recommended.\\n\\nEDIT: Nice discussion in comments.

       "  'review': \"I have put so many hours into this. So-many-hours. It is one of those games where you spend so much time learning the mechanics: items, heroes, terrain, team strategy, etc. You learn all these things and it makes you want to stay with it because you've put so much work to build yourself to a decent MMR and win rate.\\nThis game is like a drug. \\nDid I enjoy it with my friends at times? Sure. But the enjoyment always fought against the weight of the overwhelming frustration.\\nIt has the most toxic community I have ever seen in my decade of serious gaming. It wasn't so bad at first, but over the past hundred or so games it has become notably worse. Far worse. Make one mistake and you will have threats from your teammates to report you. Don't have a bad game, or you will have someone urging your team and the other team to report. It's just constant bickering and trash talk on both sides. Is it like this every game? No, of course not. There are decent individuals who play this game who will present constructive criticism and encouragement in a mature fashion. They might contain their frustration during the game or voice it over the chat, and that's understandable. This game will do that. But the vast majority are, sadly, among the poison that kills this game for me. \\nA lot of the time I even ended up with teammates who didn't speak my language despite my search under US east. I can handle one or two or three or four. But when I go three games in a row where everyone on my team and the enemy team doesn't speak my language then, well, there is some great team communication there. That's really the only issue I've had with the game itself. Not too bad.\\nThe satisfaction from winning a few games can't make up for the stress and grievances encountered to get there either. \\nHonestly, this game isn't fun anymore because of the community. It is well done. It's a great game, but the community ruins the satisfying experience I once had for this game. It is a real shame. \\nI have 2,000+ hours of game time. 2,000+ hours of effort getting myself to around a 3k MMR. 2,000+ hours poured into a game that requires dedication and satisfaction through numbers and stats. And I am still going to try my best to give this game up despite all the work put into it. It will be tough. \\nIf you haven't played the game yet, I can't recommend it. Not when the community is worse than it's ever been. And I'm not basing this on just a couple dozen games. I'm basing my community experience on hundreds of recent hours. It is a real shame how the players in the game can ruin it. \\nMaybe when Overwatch comes out it will have a decent community (being optimistic) and I can pour my hours into that and finally ditch this game for good. Maybe I'll come back when my friends are on to form a team, but I will never again jump into solo ranking with the community as horrible as it is. \\nI really hate to leave a negative review on this great game, but the community has sucked the joy out of it.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Dota 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, MOBA for short. In Dota 2 is a pure free-to-play game, which means that you don't have to unlock heroes, maps or other stuff. The only way to be good at Dota 2 is to know the game. You need to know every single item and hero to become a really good player. And that's the reason i like this game so much. However, this can be a problem for new players. You don't know anything about the game when you spawn in your base with 4 teammates.\\nSo, what is this game all about? Well, you play as one of the 105 available heroes and you have to destroy the enemy base. Sounds easy right? Well, to do that you have to fight your way through towers, creeps and of course the other team. \\nAt the start of the game you just stay in your 'lane' and farm and harass enemies by attacking or even ganking them. After this 'laning stage' is completed, your team and the enemy team will face eachother in so called 'teamfights'. After a while, one team will have a large gold and experience advantage, and they will push to the other teams base. And then of course destroy it.\\n\\nVerdict\\n---------\\nI really enjoyed and still enjoy this game. Dota 2 isn't a pay-to-win game, which makes this game much more enjoyable. Dota 2 also has the best eSports support, you can easily watch a match and select one of the several Broadcasters to make watching eSport matches more enjoyable. The only downside of Dota 2 is the fact that you'll need a lot of knowledge to be good at this game.\\n\\nIf you manage to survive all the mean teammates and learn everything about the game, you'll easily spend 200 hours on Dota 2. If not, you'll quit within 25 hours.\\n\\nScore: 91/100\",\n",

       "  'review': \"After 500 hours, this game has finally broken me. The good moments, are great. But the lows, are rock bottom. I'm not talking about an intense match leading to a loss. I'm not even talking about a straight beat down. \\n\\nI'm talking about the player base.\\n\\nTHE worst thing I have ever had the pain of experiencing in the gaming world in my entire life, is the toxic players on Dota 2. The verbal abuse and complaining both in text form, and that horrid mic team chat. I thought COD lobbies were bad back in the day, but that was just kids being dumb. This here on Dota 2, is grown men swearing, screaming, using racial slurs, and crying in their mic or through their keyboard at everyone else. Winning, losing, doesn't matter. There's the whiners, the racists, the wanna-be team captains (the all in one's are my absolute favorite) the list goes on. Forget their play style, forget their hypocritical and ignorant nature, their lack of self-accountability, or how good/bad they themselves are doing. Although these things add to the frustration of listening to them, it's not what truly bothers me. What truly has worn me down is the fact that these people exist in almost EVERY SINGLE MATCH. If they aren't on my own team, they are on the other, usually both. Which proves to me that Valve does nothing to actually get rid of them, or so many people have dropped this game for the same reason that all there is left are these toxic people. The thing that sucks about all this is you kinda NEED communication on the team in order to win a game. If I mute everyone, or the couple toxic ones, I won't see call outs or strategic moves (I don't think I've ever won a game with these people on my team regardless.) Dota 2 is nothing but a cesspool of the most toxic gamers on the planet. \\nOn a positive note, at least it was free.\\n\\nP.S. If you're feeling defensive reading this, I got some bad news for you, you're that guy bud.\\n\\nTLDR: The toxicity of this player base has finally destroyed my last ounce of will to play this game for another second. Don't play it unless you want to slowly whither away like I have, or last long enough to become one of them.\\n\\nWell here goes another 500 hours...\",\n",

The majority of the community is quite unpleasant at times and isn't very beginner-friendly which can be really off-putting. If you ignore these people (a.k.a. muting) and just keep doing your thing, you will find yourself genuinely having fun after ~50 hours. 50 hours sounds kinda extreme but it really isn't. This is the kind of game you can spend thousands of hours on and you still won't be able to fully master it.\\n\\nIf you're ready to go through all this hardship and frustration, go for it, I highly recommend DotA 2.\\nIf you're looking for a casual multiplayer game that you can get into quickly, stay away from this.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"It is very hard to recommend Dota 2 in its current state, and that comes from someone that loved it and played it since the Warcraft III days.\\n\\nThough the recent gameplay evolutions are what compelled me to quit playing six months ago, this is a matter of personal taste and is only the last of series of underlying, objective problems that plague the game since years and that Valve failed to adress.\\nI've been playing Dota 2 from 2014 to 2019 and have since then took a backseat and continued to watch the game's evolution hoping that its dismal state was only temporary and that soon, Valve would step in and do a great Spring Cleaning.\\n\\nIn no particular order : \\n\\n[b]Matchmaking[/b] : despite anything ever promised by Valve, the quality of matchmaking is abysmal because the difference between player skill, language, behaviour score and availability are so high most games feel like roulette.\\nIt creates a bad circle, as more players leave, the less players remain for the matchmaker to form coherent teams with\\n\\n[b]Player toxicity[/b] : Every online game, especially competitive ones have their share of the cake, and I greatly contributed to this cause, I won't lie, but as opposed to other games, both from Valve or its concurrents, the banhammer never seem to land on the right heads. How could it do so with only a fixed number of weekly reports that run out by tuesday ?\\nThe very little amount of new players and proper new player experience (tutorials, beginner pools, etc.) will make the game very painful as a beginner unless you have a very competitive and resilient mindset\\n\\n[b]Poor maintenance[/b] : This is the biggest offender in the book, for many people and one of the most visible problems : Valve experimented many different features but most of them were ignored by their own developers. This goes from trivial, cosmetic features to their companion app that was only maintained for the three first months to their paid subscription service that never received content updates after launch.\\nThe game is ripe with abandoned features lying in plain sight, in every menu and of course that's a source of player frustration, and the same goes with a huge performance creep that affects some users : the games loses a few fps after each updates without significant visual changes, and this hinders players that were able to play the game on older machines but can't anymore.\\nIn addition some quality of life features like replay takeover were either removed and reintroduced behind a paywall, or simply abandoned; which brings us to the next point :\\n\\n[b]The Battle Passes[/b] : Year after year they broke all prize pool records, and Valve moved the goalposts one crank up each time. It's hard to blame a game company for taking the money of its customers, but year after year it crept to the point you need more than €/$ 300 to unlock everything, roughly ten times as much as in 2014, where grinding levels without paying was much, much easier.\\n\\n[b]Gameplay evolution[/b] : This one is a personal pet peeve, and not a measurable con, your mileage may vary. I dislike the neutral items and artificial item caps, as I feel they create too many edge cases and exceptions in a game that encourages strategic creativity with a fixed set of rules. You may or may not like this change, but it's what drove me out of the game 6 months ago.\\n\\nIf you read until this point, congrats and thank you for taking the time to read the 2 cents of a stranger on the Internet <3\\n\\nIn conclusion, I would say this is a very reluctant thumb down as I loved this game, through the last half-decade Dota 2 gave me many laughs, tears, and made me meet great teammates, but in its current state the game istn't enjoyable unless you have a very particular mindset and an existent skill level. \\nIt's sad, it's like seeing an old friend leave.\\n\\nNote :this review  may contain traces of typos or shitty syntax\\n\\nedit : a word\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Dota 2 is the semi-sequel/remake/re-release/evolution of the long-running WarCraft 3 mod Defense of the Ancients, which in itself was based on a custom map for StarCraft called Aeons of Strife. After the release of the original Dota map in 2003, the WarCraft 3 community began producing a long line of Dota spin-offs, sequels and mods (just as Eul, Dota\\'s creator, had used AoS as inspiration for Dota itself), which culminated in the release of DotA: Allstars by Steve \"Guinsoo\" Feak.\\n\\nAllstars would become the most dominant and consistently updated version of all the Dota maps and mods. In 2005, Guinsoo passed the torch to the enigmatic IceFrog, who has been supporting, updating, and shaping Dota ever since. His changes have been the most significant, the most popular (the mod grew more during his time than ever before), and arguably have benefited and enriched Dota as a whole. By 2010, DotA: Allstars became simply DotA, and IceFrog was showing no signs of stopping. Later that year, Dota 2 was formally announced (with its development spear-headed by both IceFrog and Eul, both of its most important \"authors\"; its past and present, alike), entered a semi-closed beta in late 2011, and was finally officially released in mid-2013... and the rest is history.\\n\\nHistory lessons aside, Dota 2 is a game of uncompromising depth and complexity. Though its gameplay intricacies can appear opaque, arbitrary and incomprehensible at first sight, the way these expansive game mechanics interact with one another when exposed to the element of player imperfection is truly remarkable: over a hundred heroes, each with at least four spell-based abilities and all capable of using up to six magical items, from a massive arsenal of over a hundred. Games can last anywhere from 25 to 55 minutes, and possibly far more!\\n\\nDota\\'s metagame is constantly shifting, and as of writing the game and mod are at total parity through version 6.80, released earlier this year. On top of that, it is completely free to play, with no features locked out to any players whatsoever. Not even cosmetic items, which form the backbone of the game\\'s vast micro-transaction-based economy: these items are freely distributed by Valve to all players through level-based gift drops and random-chance item drops. Free game updates alter the game balance significantly, while introducing new seasonal game modes, and far more. And that\\'s not even scratching the surface of the game\\'s competitive scene, with its many tournaments, its constantly evolving teams and its own storylines, all leading up to the annual Valve-organized grand championship: The International.\\n\\nIt may be incredibly difficult and frustrating at first, but given time, patience, simple memory and a keen mind, anyone can ultimately come to see Dota as perhaps the most enjoyable, enthralling and captivating game experience ever conceived. Oh, and it\\'s [b][i]sort of fun[/b][/i]. Sort of.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Dota stands for \"Defense of the Ancients\", or as I like to call it, Dota. The two is not to refer to the game being a sequel, which it is, but rather to specify the number of ancients in a game. The objective is to turn it into Dota 1. \\nIn Dota, you need to defend an ancient, which is either a tree or a rock depending on your religious affiliation. Since I\\'m one and two-thirds Bhuddist, I usually end up defending one of them at random, much like all the other players. \\nDota is a very unique game, in that includes both offense and defense. There are lots of characters, and all of them are mostly good at different things. \\nIn my opinion, the best part of Dota is playing it. This is because Dota is an extremely unique combining many difficult strategies, such as attacking the enemy team\\'s Ancient or defending your own Ancient. \\nThe goal of Dota, much like other games, is to win. If you become proficient at this skill, you will win very often, leading to more victories. Scientists show that six out of every three Dota players that win matches tend to be on the winning team when the game is over. This is because winning substantially increases your chances of not losing. \\nDota takes a while to learn though, and that is because it is an extremely offensive, yet defensive, game with many complicated nuances, like being a farmer or trying to help your teammates do good. One interesting feature of Dota is that dying is really bad, in the sense that you lose money and time because respawns are really long, like when Halo 3 would just beep at you instead of spawning you and you\\'d get really angry, except this is an intentional feature intended to spice up the classic innovation of offfense vs. defense vs. offense. \\nWhy did I write a third position in that last sentence? Excellent question. There are neutral enemies in the game, and they usually don\\'t do a whole lot except sit there and be neutral. If you don\\'t respect their space, however, you may find that they beging to fight back, much like an offensive form of self-defense. \\n\\nEarly in a match of Dota, you find yourself buying useful items like tp scrolls, also called Town Portal Scrolls, or Town Portal Scrolls for short. Why did I mention Town Portal Scrolls multiple times? Good question! That is because there are multiple teams. \\nOnce you\\'ve bought items, you go kill enemy creeps, and they aren\\'t people so it\\'s ethically sound and completely morally fine to do. :) Once you\\'ve spilt some blood, or watched as they comically struggle to kill each other for your favor, you may realize that you have more money and have leveled up. That is because creeps are made of gold stitched together by experience and points, and that usually transfers to you after they die. Think of it like inheritance or maybe a n involuntary tribute system. \\nOnce you\\'ve levelled up and gotten rich, you can buy better items that make you stronger, and then get new abilities like skills, active abilities, passive abilities, or passive-aggressive abilities. These abilities let you hurt creeps and other palyers more effectively, which may or may not be socially acceptable in your region of birth. Please refer to local ethic codes and statutes to determine whether victory is a viable gameplay style for you in your chosen country of choice. \\n\\nOnce you\\'ve become the best all-around person you can be, or at least made some incremental progress down that road that usually takes about an hour on average, (resets between games, so you never get bored) it\\'s time to go tear down the other team\\'s towers (those, like many buildings in the united states, canada, or certain US territories, will fight back and damage you) and then eventually go and destroy their Ancient, which is what the A stands for in Dota. That makes your team the winner, and implies that you are better people in a metaphorical sense than your enemy team counterparts.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Dota 2 is one of the deepest, most satisfying and equally frustrating gaming experiences in this era. I still love the game, and it\\'s such an excitement to watch as an \"e-sport\". However, it really should come with a warning. Playing, or rather learning to play Dota is a part time job; the time investment in this game is huge. You will get cussed out, have terrible back-to-back matches and a new patch will come along and make your favourite heroes a pain to play. That said, if you have the time, you\\'d be hard pressed to find a more satisfying feeling than getting that perfect initiation or landing a 5-man ultimate. AND THE COMEBACKS! It is possible to comeback when your team is getting their ass handed to them, so don\\'t give up. \\n\\nTLDR - Must play if you have the time and patience',\n",

       "  'review': 'PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME\\n\\nI hope many of you can read this review. I spent 3570 hours in this game, equivalent to almost 5 months if I play the game non-stop. So I understand the game pretty well, but I can tell you one thing that this game is not worth your time and please stay away from it.\\n\\nThe current DOTA 2 community is a very toxic community. I began my Dota 2 journey as a very friendly and nice guy. How am I like after years playing Dota? Well, just as toxic as the rest of the community (of course there are many good guys). I flamed people, I scolded and insulted people. Why did that happen? Think of it this way, if you stay with a friend who insults you every single day (sometimes just for nothing), be mad at you every day and sooner or later you will just behave the exact same way to him and other people. Dota players nowadays are just like that. If you wanna be a good and nice guy, just dont bother thinking of this game. If you talk nicely to your dota teammates and teach them the right things, what is the answer you\\'re gonna get? \"Fuck you\",\"Shut the fuck up you moron\".\\n\\nAnyway please look for more reviews that reveal the truth of playing this game and you will get what I mean. I know there will be guys who disagree with me, but honestly I hope this game will die soon coz I strongly believe it does not make this world a better place. (if not saying it makes the world a worse place). Please guys, save your time on something else.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I really love this game, and if you like moba then you should try it, the gameplay should not be hard to understand, a big map divided into three routes (Top, Mid and Bot), two teams of 5 players (5vs5), many heroes with different ability and tasks (support, carry, tank), the goal of the teams is to reach the enemy base by destroying enemy tower and minions, there are lots of mechanical and things to learn but it'svery simple if you take time to read a guide or/and play the tutorial. \\none suggestion is to not get depressed by elitist person who will tell you things like: F**k you, your dad, F***ing SS! etc. because there are lot of people like that.\\nhowever, in my opinion what makes dota different from other moba is the tactics / strategies usable, well balanced (recently I've some doubt xD), based heavily on skills, a lot of heroes to choose to play and have fun with, totally free and frequently updated.\\none of the biggest problems I found is communication, for example when you select EU server and English language, the game start and is most of time like..\\nMe: Hello guys ^^\\nTeam:привет друг\\nTeam:merhaba arkadaşım\\nTeam:Hola amiga\\nTeam:朋友你好\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This game is, as a game, very well produced. The mechanics of the game are actually rather fun. That said, there is a pretty steep learning curve, just like with any other MOBA. With over a hundred different heroes, all with different combinations of stats and abilities, plus a litany of augmenting items to buy for various situations, it can be pretty daunting to learn, and nigh impossible to master. This is not why I don't recommend this game, though. Plenty of games are challenging to learn and impossible to master. Chess, for example, matches that description.\\n\\nThis game is something else, not because of the production quality of the game, but because of the people who play it. Chess players can be a bit ivory tower, I will admit, but you will almost never encounter a chess player who will fully freak out at you when one little salvo doesn't go their way and suggest that you engage in egregiously lewd, inappropriate, and criminal sexual acts with close family members. I would not recommend this game to anybody who doesn't have at least four other friends who want to consistently play together. By and large, the community of players is completely and absolutely toxic. In over 200 hours of playing this game, I can count on one hand the number of matches I have played with even a single random player (read: found through matchmaking and not one of my friends) on my team in which I haven't been at least mildly offended. To be fair, it can be really challenging to embrace the spirit of competition when you join an unfamiliar and terribly mechanically complex game, but the community at large does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to make that any easier. If I didn't have a squad of 7 people who regularly play in some combination or another together after work and on weekends -- if I was joining this game on my own -- I would have ragequit and thrown my computer out my fourth story window, or perhaps worse, stuck it out and developed a serious mental illness from the sheer and utter toxicity of the community in this game. One of the solo queue games I played recently (big mistake -- don't solo queue, especially if you're new) went reasonably quickly -- it took about 45 minutes for my team to beat the other team. You'd think that would be celebrated. You'd think people would be having a good time. You would be absolutely wrong. My own teammates were verbally abusing each other pretty much the entire time. MY. OWN. TEAMMATES.\\n\\nBottom line, this game can be fun, but only if you have a full complement of friends with whom to play. If you're venturing out on your own because you want a free-to-play game with a decent following and the staying power to be worth investing time in, stay away from DOTA2. You will encounter some of the most toxic people on the face of the planet and you will HATE every minute of this addictive but completely toxic game.\",\n",

I have been playing a lot of Dota 2 though, because I don\\'t think that Dota 2 is really a \"game.\" \\n\\nI sometimes lose a game so badly that I wake, days later, in a cold sweat.

Later, in a moment of creeping fear, I will realise that the real nightmare is how bad I am at Dota... and yet I cannot stop myself from playing it.\\n\\nDota 2 is an endless nightmare from which I cannot wake. To install it is to introduce into your life a hellish netherworld, one in which close friends are so disappointed in one another that they cannot even express it.

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve spent 10 years and almost 10,000 hours playing Warcraft III DotA as well as Dota 2, and loved playing it. I\\'ve met many interesting people, fought epic battles, snatched victory from the jaws of defeat through several Herculean efforts, endured many soul crushing defeats, and even clashed with a handful of professional players. The game has changed drastically over my many years of playing, but as of about a year ago, the game became too frustrating to continue, and as I continue to watch, I am saddened by what the game has become.\\n\\nFor years my friends and I have joked about the \"League-ification\" of Dota. Dota has always been the epitome of hyper competitive cooperative gameplay, with a high emphasis on individual skill and decision making at all phases of the game, especially in punishing poor decisions. Pushing a tower alone with nobody showing on the map? Get back or you\\'re dead. Hard carry dies past 40 minutes without buyback? That\\'s a barracks down. Pick crappy laning heroes? Welcome to hell while the enemy team runs a trilane and pushes barracks at 20 minutes.\\n\\nOur jokes slowly but surely became a reality. Teleport scrolls were reduced in cost, meaning everybody rolled around with a handful because they weren\\'t a financial burden. Ways to gain gold were increased, so supports could afford to have a handful of items in the mid game. The rubber band effect was introduced, and pushing strategies were neutered. You pick a lineup to take towers and take one unfavorable engagement and the game\\'s over, whereas previously the greedier lineup would have to do more work than a single fight to overcome the gold advantage. The cost of boots was reduced, taking boots first strategies from a sure sign that you were bad to a viable strategy. Strong laners also got pushed out. Dominating the early game became effectively irrelevant as killing giant money bag heroes in the midgame would slingshot the trailing team into the lead.\\n\\nThe worst casualty has been the versatility of the game. Metas change and stuff goes in and out of favor, that\\'s fine and fair, but certain aspects have become imperative to have. A support with a hard save, a hard carry that can fight in the early mid game. Bad laning heroes can just be sent mid, while traditional skill mid heroes are just sent to the safelane. When you take a big lead, the plan is almost always just farm out the map until you can\\'t possibly lose when taking the high ground, as taking a risk will not just result in you losing a fight, but most likely the lead.\\n\\nThe game that I grew up with that punishes the smallest mistakes is a distant memory, and we are left with a mid game brawler. I wish Dota 2 the best as it progresses, but the core mechanics have been changed so drastically that I can neither play nor watch it without feeling like something that was once an unrelenting niche game has been formed to cater to the whims of the massive casual audience that it has attracted.',\n",

       "  'review': \"This is the best MOBA game ever made, simply a masterpiece, but also has one of the worst communities. I sometimes end up frustrated, tired and in a bad mood when i can't win a single game in 6 hours of straight gameplay just because of bad players who get in your games to ruin them. Theyre're not just noobs, they just love trolling and ****ing up others people fun.\\n\\nIf you're noob and wish to play Dota, make sure you have patience and time. Becoming good in this game is really hard, takes years to master and you'll never get to call yourself a pro. \\n\\nIf you decided to start Dota, DO NOT play online. Practice with bots first, read guides, read items and abilities descriptions first, you got to study before playing in a real game with humans. It can be very frustrating for old players to deal with people that simple come to ''try out'' a new game into their matches and ruin them. Please. Someday you will realize what i mean with this.\\n\\nI play DotA since 2007 (Dota 1) and I have hit my keyboard, laughed, yell'd to my girlfriend for no reason and even let my bad mood affect my scores in school because instead of studying math, I decided to stay late playing and made me lose time I could spend with friends. Lost many good stuff I could have done out-game because I said ''One more match...'' which became 10 more matches... and ended up totally frustrated without winning one of them, unable to sleep well those nights. Due to this, to the careless community and the fact that your mood can be affected by DotA and how it makes you feel, i can't recommend this game.\\n\\nDota is not just another game to your library. You have to be very careful when you decide to play this.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Dota 2 is basically Valve bringing a very popular mod from Warcraft 3 (DotA) into their proprietary. It\\'s the game that truly popularized the MOBA genre, which is inspired by the Aeon of Strife mod from Starcraft. Everything you see in other MOBAs, such as League of Legends, Heroes of Newerth, and other similar MOBAs, all had their roots in DotA. Anyway, in this game, you choose a hero and fight alongside your allies in a 5 vs 5 arena. The main goal here is to destroy your opponents Ancient before they do. Along the way, you kill creeps, whether enemies or neutral ones, to get gold and experience. You can also kill off enemy Heroes for even more gold and experience. The experience is then used to level up, getting more skills and talents, while the gold is used to buy items to boost your own stats, or to help out allies.\\n\\nThe best thing with this game is that, its truly flexible. A hero is not rigidly tied to a particular role, for example a hero can be played as a support, or even a carry, based on item choice or team composition. You can choose any hero any time, without having to go through some pre-requisites to unlock them e.g. in game currency, hours played etc). Not only heroes, everything you need for the heroes are not gated by account levels or hours of game time or in game currency. Also, this game is utterly free to play. The only thing you need to pay is practically customization for your heroes or your accounts.\\n\\nThat being said, being a very competitive game, stakes run high in game, with random people may getting more tilted or more prone for blaming on others when mistakes occur, hence the game may be really unfriendly toward newbies. This kind of hostile environment may be quite a turn off for newcomers, though Valve is really making effort is trying to minimize the hostilities, with recent updates. Other than that, the other biggest issue that I have with this game, even though it\\'s not an issue, is that, this game will suck the life out of you. I mean that not in a bad way, but once you enjoy it, it will hook you in like how Pudge or Clockwerk keep hooking my hero. After one game, regardless whether its a good game or a bad game, it will tell you \"One more time.\" \\n\\nIf you are into MOBAs, I would seriously recommend this game, despite how hostile some players may be, due to how in depth the mechanics are, and with friends, it would be a blast, coordinating attacks, or even doing silly team builds. If you are new to this genre, I would recommend to give this game a try. \\n\\n8.8/10. Would like Pudge or Clockwerk to hook my Crystal Maiden again (but seriously, please don\\'t aim me).',\n",

       "  'review': 'After over 3000 hours of gameplay, I can safely sum Dota 2 up in two words:\\n\\nTHE TRENCH (aka Forced Fifty)\\n\\nYou will win. You will lose. You will improve your skill, but you will never improve your score. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--wait for it--\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo. Matter. What. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhy? Because of THE TRENCH / ForcedFifty. \\n\\n-The better you get at this game, the worse your teammates will be. This is not a paradigm, it is mechanically programmed into the game. \\n-If you can carry 1 idiot on your team, the game will handicap you with 2. Skilled enough to carry 2? After a few games you will get 3. Hardcore enough for 3? Now you get FOUR-ever. \\n-Your teammates will -- i ♥♥♥♥ you not－－ go out of their way to lose on purpose. You picked another carry because it seemed logical? Well guess what, I got a few replays that will show crybabies throwing the game so you cant compete for thier spotlight. This is the only game where teammates ENJOY LOSING because it means they can bring you down to their garbage level. \\n-People literally buy and sell accounts off MMR because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammates and you will be a guinea pig in their money making ponzi schemes. Have fun wasting hours of your time on 4k MMR (the alleged decent tier) while you witness first hand feeders lose you the game minute by minute. \\n\\n\\nI could have been a doctor with those 3000 hours.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1] Quitting this thing was the best thing that ever happened to me....now i live a stress free life with no worries of KS and pub nightmare. [/h1]\\n\\nJokes aside….Dota 2 for me was unique? It’s the ONLY MOBA game that I spent over 1000h of playtime. That for me is quite something since im not a huge fan of MOBA games. Well here are the reasons why i enjoyed playing Dota 2:\\n\\n[h1] The Pros [/h1]\\n(+) [b] Solid game to practice teamwork & strategize gameplan [/b]\\nWhen you have a solid team vs team gameplay this game really shine. Cause it puts your knowledge on pick or counterpick of characters and ability to adapt against your opponent playstyle. Not to mention the many choices of items to help you execute your style,\\n\\n(+) [b] Many game modes to keep you entertained [/b]\\nAlthough me and my team mostly play normal matches, since I just feel like playing this game casually but if you're really bored you can do some hilariously stupid stuff if you play ability draft. Not to mention there are some extra modes now since I last play. Or if you feel like playing in a sorta competitive environment (assuming you don’t pug this) you can pick captain mode.\\n\\nThat’s pretty much the only good stuff I could think of after burning hours into the game. Not always sun shine and rainbow that’s all I can say. But had a great run nonetheless.\\n\\n[h1] The Cons [/h1]\\nPub was a nightmare….as for balancing issue between heroes, I never really paid that much attention to it. Not going to discuss more about it. \\n\\nSince I mostly play on the SEA server, RQ and disconnection issue are an everyday thing….but that doesn’t make it less annoying. If I get a dollar everytime someone DC I’d probably be loaded by now lmao. That’s pretty much the only problem I have with the game, the online experience!. Visual, sound, and performance wise I have no issue whatsoever.\\n\\n[h1] Verdict [/h1]\\nSo did I enjoy the game? well it’s a yes and no. Great game when you have a lot of free time on your hand and group of friends to play with but a nightmare if you have to play solo and don’t have as much free time as you used to. Even though i'm on the fence about this, based on my experience playing this i'm leaning toward toward the no side….can’t speak for others but that’s how I felt.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[b][u]2021:[/u][/b]  \\nGameplay is faster and the playerbase has matured to be higher skilled.  \\nFrom a hero depth/pool perspective, it has reduced compared to last year, but it is still fairly good, although some heroes have been relegated to fringe picks.\\n\\nTalents have largely been balanced to make both options equally viable and depends on the game flow.  \\nThe later talents are now more impactful while the earlier ones focus more on small bonuses to complement a hero\\'s other abilities or to shore up a weakness.\\n\\nAghanim\\'s Shard create an additional layer of depth for gameplay and serve to increase the stakes around subsequent Roshan kills. However, some heroes have better Shard upgrades and balance should be worked on more here.\\n\\n\\n\\n[b][u]2020:[/u][/b]  \\nFrom a gameplay perspective, the game has actually improved and had much more depth.  \\n\\n1. Neutral items shine and have their place in the dynamics of the game, adding much excitement to the mid and lategame stages.  \\n2. Bounty runes have been finetuned to finally give the game a lot more relevance to support heroes. It incentivised the 2-1-2 lane setup and there is more emphasis on all stages of the game, opening up the hero pool of offlane, which has traditionally been limited to a handful of heroes.  \\n3. New heroes: Snapfire and Void Spirit, have been great and add much more interesting gameplay dynamics.  \\n4. Seasonal gameplay modes were extremely well-done. Aghanim\\'s Labyrinth was by far the most interesting and fun roguelite ARPG that had an easy pickup curve and a high skill ceiling with multiple ways of playing.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s been a great year for Dota 2 gameplay-wise, but its annual marketing event: The International, did not happen and the playerbase took a hit. \\nI am confident it will rebound once the pandemic ends and The International comes back!\\n\\n[b][u]2019:[/u][/b]\\nDid not play much for this year due to work. However, the 7.23 update has me tits excited! LOL!\\n\\n[b][u]2017-2018:[/u][/b]\\nDid not play much for this year due to work.\\n\\n[b][u]2016:[/u][/b]\\nAfter 5 years of Dota 2, all the heroes are finally released and the next newest hero, Monkey King is coming out in December this year.\\nDota 2 has become a spectator sport in the footsteps of traditional sports such as Basketball and Football, in the sense that they are all team-oriented games and require strategy to win.  \\n\\nThrough the recent gameplay patches of 6.87 and 6.88, there have been many new changes that focuses more on the strategic aspects of the game, namely Scans and cheaper more defensive items.\\nNew items such as Echo Sabre and Hurricane Pike also serve to make competitive games more exciting as teams that have fallen behind in the early game now have a chance to comeback with the cheaper mid-tier but very cost-efficient items giving them an opportunity to fight back.\\n\\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZobqKSSGPw][b][i]\"Everything can work\"[/i][/b][/url]\\n\\nAs a whole, Dota 2 has become [b]a game very much focused on positioning and the right draft composition of heroes[/b] for the game match at hand. \\nNo particular strategy has dominated the tournament scene this year, be it push, defensive splitpush, or teamfight, and it is this remarkable balance that allows many teams with varied style tendencies to showcase their way of playing without feeling disadvantaged. Be it EG\\'s methodical lane dominance and calm style, MVP Phoenix\\'s all-in teamfight style, EHOME\\'s strategic drafting style, or TI6 Winners - Wings\\' anything goes style.\\n\\nValve has also shown interest in further expanding the game through its released custom games feature for Dota 2 and Virtual Reality support for spectating. \\n\\nOverall, its been a good year for Dota 2, the game is more fun than ever with any strategy being workable, all heroes being viable in competitive tournaments and more expanded options for spectating, viewing games and analysing replays and statistics that aficionados would love.\\n\\n[b][u]2015:[/u][/b]\\nOver the course of a year, Dota 2 has slowly introduced its Source 2 game client, which allows for easier integration of custom games similar to the original system of Warcraft 3\\'s Battle.net. The International 2015 tournament is also a huge success and has a record $18.4 million, of which $16.8 million were contributed by community spending. Valve has also revealed its future plans for the game in the form of quarterly Majors tournaments that is meant to further develop its competitive scene and community interest.\\nIt is also clear that Dota 2 will be taking a seasonal games events approach towards stimulating community support, with obvious targets being December Holidays, Chinese New Year and Halloween. \\nWith regards to porting over Dota 1\\'s legacy, there are only 2 heroes left: Arc Warden and Pitlord; and they are likely to be introduced with the aforementioned games events.\\nAt this point, the longevity of Dota 2 is very much secured in the foreseeable future due to Valve\\'s Steam Client storefront, massive player base and successful implementation of cosmetic item sales that do not affect gameplay.\\n\\nIcefrog, you did the right thing by choosing to work with Valve for Dota 2\\'s future back in 2010. I hope that you continue to work on your legacy and enjoy the feelings of joy, happiness, rage, sadness and comradery that you have brought to millions of people worldwide.\\n\\n[b][u]2014:[/u][/b]\\nDota 2 just keeps improving over time. At the rate this game is progressing, it is likely that it will still be around 5-10 years later. The community keeps expanding and the content updates are constant and full of exciting new features. Seasonal events bring about new quests and co-op gameplay that make good use of the core game\\'s heroes\\' abilities. The cosmetic items economy is healthy and ever booming with more and more workshop artists contributing. As a competitive game oriented towards esports, Dota 2\\'s professional scene has certainly expanded exponentially and The International\\'s prizepool over the years can be seen as an indicator. It has grown exponentially from $1.6 million in 2012, to $2.9 million in 2013 and is projected to hit $10 million in 2014.\\nDota 2 has also recently implemented Ranked Matchmaking, which allows players the opportunity to play games for an ELO-style rating. While it has exploits and flaws at its debut, the subsequent updates over time have vastly improved the experience. It is a welcome new feature and it enables players interested in a more competitive experience to play to their best abilities, knowing that their teammates and opponents will likely put in the same amount of effort.\\n\\n[b][u]2013:[/u][/b]\\nValve Inc. has proven that they will continue to support Dota 2 in all aspects and maintain a healthy esports scene. The game caters to all spectrums of players, be it casual, competitive or spectator.\\nMatchmaking system still has its design flaws and the game still lacks a way to convey to competitive players their skill level and standings/ratings.\\n\\n[b][u]2012:[/u][/b]\\nDota 2 requires huge player investment, but provides magnificent and immeasurable rewards for commitment.\\nhttp://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/08/21/dota-2-pt1/\\nNow free to play! All heroes are free and available. Items are available for purchase for each individual hero, they do not affect the game balance at all as they are purely cosmetic, and the colors and items fit Dota 2\\'s medieval setting.\\n\\n[b][u]2011:[/u][/b]\\nThis is a game for the competitive PC gamers. DOTA 2, the sequel to DotA features better character animations, mechanics, graphics and interface design. The ease of matchmaking, connecting with your friends and playing a cooperative team game all culminate together to make DOTA 2 a complete game experience. No two games are the same and despite this game still being in beta, it is already a great experience akin to other AAA PC games out there. \\nThis game is a definite buy for me. What will it be for you?',\n",

You all are probably like \"well, there are these people who have spent thousands of hours in the game, so that\\'s not many.\" But do take into account that my total time owning this game hasn\\'t even exceeded a year yet. There is not a day I remember since I got this game that I haven\\'t at least opened DOTA 2. Usually to play a public game, sometimes to play a bot game, and sometimes to brush up on hero knowledge and look at guides. This game will ruin your life and obliterate all your free time. My only warning to new players is that the community it pretty toxic to new players, and not everyone speaks english. Just mute anyone calling you a noob, flaming you, etc. But never do so to the people that legitimately want to help you.\\n\\nOverall Rating: 11.6/10.',\n",

       "  'review': \"This is an amazing, dynamic game. I've met more friends on here than through any other game. But it's addictive as hell. I've found myself being lulled into a sense of comfort just by the ambient sounds. I see a jester somewhere and automatically want to play as Rubik, and I have an urge to start the game up. You will judge everyone else you play this with, you will mull over every little second of a 56 minute game, and it'll make you a horrible pathetic person.\\n\\nThere's no reason to play this unless you need a time sink that'll come around to having a measure of control of your life. There's single player games where you go 'one more turn' and it turns into a night's afair of staying up late. But this game you start planning a whole day around raising your MMR by 200 points. Why? Because if you managed it, it'd make you feel better. What other games does your mood revolve around whether you play well, and how many other games can you name where you'd take that 'feeling good' to the point of willingly sacrificing an entire day to it?\\n\\nUnless you've got a team of people to play with, and you don't care how much you suck, or you're actually a pro-gamer with an active team looking for a transition, don't waste your time. There's plenty of other things to do with literally 100+ days of your life.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I've played Dota a lot. Like, A LOT. I've come to the conclusion that yes, the gameplay is fun, it can be fun with friends, and it is rewarding sometimes, I highly do not recommend it to new people. The community is 16 shades of toxic, the report system is, the best I can describe it, extremely useless, as well, it just shows a total lack of effort from Valve, and their lack of effort to improve the community. One person on your team feeding and raging? Oh well, unless people from another game report him, he's probably not getting low priority. If you play more than one match of Dota a day, you'll probably run out of the allotted weekly reports (3) rather quickly, and the only way to get more within the week is if they act upon the person you report. I've had multiple games with people feeding, spam pinging, or being toxic as hell in general. Whole team reports them, nothing happens. The report was wasted and it feels like a suggestion box connected directly to a trash can. The low priority system just needs to be completely redone. The whole thing is ineffectual, and usually ends up being one maybe two people in the game who got low priority because of Internet problems (I've suffered from quite a few of these and thus my knowledge of the hell that is low priority), while the rest are ragers, spam pingers, and feeders. Yes Dota has very intellegent gameplay, and tons of depth and can be hours and hours of replayable fun, however, with the community how it is, the terrible punishment/report system, and valve's total lack in interest to fix any problems that aren't related to making money, I have to recommend you not download Dota 2\\n\\nUpdate: 3500 hours and 2 years later and everything I mentioned here is still relevant. Smurfs are more rampant than ever. You have a 1/5 chance of playing a 5 stack game without there being a smurf. Good luck.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably won’t suit you if you’re looking to play casually. There’s a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, there’s a wild and exciting variety of play here that’s unmatched, even by its peers. It’s a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that it’s completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isn’t just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win!!!',\n",

RIP Dota”\\n“All these improvements were already done in every other MOBA in existence, therefore DOTA is coping them! RIP Dota” \\nEtc etc\\n\\nIt doesn’t take a genius to see most criticism against this patch has no actual basis.\\nI’ll mostly focus on the HUD because it’s the most irracional criticism at the moment.\\n\\nI have over 2k Dota 2 hours, that’s quite a bit, I’m used to it. But literally every person I tried to introduce to Dota 2 complained about the HUD, two of them dropped the game because they felt it was too uncomfortable.\\nSo for the same of most new players sanity, Valve decided to change the HUD for a more clear, simple and easy to navigate HUD\\n\\nYou’d think older players would like it too right? Where’s the down point on it?\\n\\nBut nooooo, the most elitist and hardcore Moba community doesn’t like its buttons, too small, it’s too hard to click.\\n….\\nLaughable right? The self proclaimed most mature Moba community, whining like 12 years old because it’s not they way it used to be.\\n\\nDon’t even get me started on the new features like talents. Do you know what we had before talents? We’d spend points on atributes, it was so useless rarely you would see someone spending on atributes before having maxed all skills. So they though that giving the game more depth would make players happy right? Wrong, because HotS already has it :^)\\nBasically whatever good feature was implemented on other MOBA before Dota is not welcome here.\\n\\nambient effects, have been improved. And the versus screen looks cool when the match starts.\\n\\nThat’s all I could notice last time I played the game. Now, I’m not in the mood to play the game again.\\n\\nR.I.P. Dota 2.',\n",

       "  'review': 'DOTA 2 is my favorite way. The program lets me assume the role of another creature, helping me experience our oneness with the universe.\\n\\nI like to assume the position of the dinosaur-riding, lightning-wielding, half-lizard half-man. I like to join servers with up to nine other disciples, be “Disruptor” (as he is called), and go to the jungle, closing my eyes; there I concentrate on my breathing. \\n\\nThe other disciples (woefully) always curse at me. I usually have to mute them. I do so to concentrate on being one with the virtual nature. (I can’t afford to go to national parks, so this is the best thing). Sometimes I see lots of colorful exclamations points and these “PING PING PING PING PING” sounds occur around my character. They are beautiful.\\n \\nOne time someone said, “THE FUCK?! LEVEL 1 DISRUPTOR, BUY COURIER YOU FUCKING RETARD!” And the truth is there are many players like him. They aren’t at peace with themselves. Perhaps if he came into the forest and hummed koans with me, and he had done so as the giant, walking tree, then he would see his greater consciousness. All the negative energy would leave his body, and we’d share a moment of experiencing our Buddha nature. \\n\\nIn my experience, sessions last about 10-20 minutes. And initially it did not take long to find a server; apparently I’ve been moved to “low-priority matchmaking.” But that’s okay. I just assume the lotus position in my chair and wait patiently. The only downside to this is that sometimes I forget to click the \"accept\" button.',\n",

The only paid content are cosmetical items that do not change gameplay. Graphics are great. Gameplay is great. Crashes are very minimal. ITS FREE.\",\n",

You can pick from 3-4 basic abilities which also can set as \"active\" or \"passive\" or \"aura\" (which is passive with influence on others team or enemy, also on you as \"caster of aura\"). When your character progress to level 6 you will be able to \"open or add\" an \"ULTRA SKILL\" that will give you an \"active or passive\" ultimate spell or skill.

       "  'review': 'There are three things you need to understand to choose or reject Dota:\\n\\nMATCHMAKING IS RIGGED.  The programmers are not interested in fair matches.  They\\'re interested in keeping as many butts in seats as possible.  That means optimizing 50% win rate for all 10 players in the game.  In a fair matchmaking algorithm, it would simply match people of similar skill level and experience.  You can observe after a few hundred hours that it does not do that at all.  \\n\\nIt will match massively skilled people with mentally ill people (proven by their in-game behavior and comments).  It will match pro players with brand new players.  You will notice that the other team simply has 5 average players.  They are the ones chosen to win for that match.  Even 2 pros can\\'t compensate for 2 or 3 brand new or mentally ill players.\\n\\nSo this is how it identifies players who can force win/loss, uses those people as pawns to rig the match, ends win streaks, and optimizes 50% win rate for all 10 players.\\n\\nIf you can tolerate your time being wasted by such scamming software, that abuses your gaming time, puts you into unwinnable situations just to feed their market share and maximize user base?  Go ahead and try it out.\\n\\nBEHAVIOR SCORE IS RIGGED.  There are no morals involved with your behavior score, which could get you censored, or thrown into \"low priority\" where you\\'ll wait in 30 minute queues for a match, and be forced to win with some of the most deranged people in order to play with *somewhat* less corrupt people.\\n\\nHow your behavior score is determined?  Simply: people arbitrarily report you for not doing what they think you should be doing, for saying things they don\\'t like when they are gaslighting and bullying people, and even out of envy of your superiority to them in the game.  There is no standard for review, no moral guidelines for adjudication, just arbitrary mob-rule.  So if you are matched with generally immoral and corrupt people, and you happen to be a good person, you will get reported by the scumbags, and penalized in your matchmaking in the future just because you are a good person, who is disliked by corrupt people.\\n\\nTHE GAME REQUIRES INTELLECT.  If the two previous facts about the game still don\\'t turn you off, here is the good thing about it.  In order to succeed, you have to memorize an enormous lexicon of items, skills, heroes, sounds, imagery, and numeric values.  You have to instantaneously apply that memory to your hero in order to succeed.  You have to think tactically and strategically, and you have to have a decent emotional IQ to rapidly judge your teammates and enemies for social parameters.  Are they aggressive?  Are they skilled?  Are they clever?  Are they cooperative or are they loners?  What are they focusing upon?  How can you adapt to optimize your contribution to your allies and threat to the enemy?\\n\\nIt is a great game if my third claim overrides your loathing of the first two claims.  \\n\\nTHE DOTA PROGRAMMERS COULD FIX IT by changing the matchmaking algorithm to only match similarly skilled players as judged by their INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE rather than wins/losses.  They must grade the player based upon their contribution even when matched to horrific teammates, and given a loss.  \\n\\nThey must stop matching new players with pros, and mentally ill players with normal players (even in unranked).  \\n\\nThey also should provide an option to never match with people who don\\'t have dota plus.  The pay wall acts as a barrier for casual and scamming players.  Dota should make them play with each other, and reward the paying customers with a priority pool of other paying customers.  Free games welcome the worst people, and forcing paying customers to be abused by their apathy and casual attitude is detrimental and fairly deranged in its inverted morality.\\n\\nOverall, if the dota programmers can fix these gross design defects, they could have one of the best games ever made.',\n",

       "  'review': 'DOTA 2 is one of those games, where if not for the issues, it would be a perfect game, but the bad outweighs the good here, the flaws of this game are sure to bring misery upon you, instead of having fun & after several years now, I don\\'t see the devs ever fixing anything.\\n\\nDOTA 2 requires teamwork to win & despite there being both ranked and unranked matchmaking, there is nothing casual about unranked. The game has a punishment system that puts you into \"low priority\" aka punishment pool, if you idle too long, abandon two out of 25 games, if your game crashes through no fault of your own, if you\\'re abusive, OR if abusive players file false reports against you; yes, they can do that.\\n\\nNow, if you\\'re okay with this flawed draconian report system and punishment pool, here is the best part; US servers are overrun with Peruvians and Hondurans that don\\'t speak English. They will likely report you for not speaking Spanish, or just being an outsider, because they have animosity towards outsiders. Unless you\\'re bilingual, good luck communicating in a game that requires it. \\n\\nStill okay with the report and punishment system, and the Peruvians?\\nRegular matches can last 60-90 minutes, and you\\'re not allowed to leave, no matter how bad the match is.\\n\\nAfter remaining in a miserable 60-90 minute match to avoid an abandon & subsequent low priority, you may still get reported by abusive players or crash, which both lead to the punishment pool. In DOTA 2 it isn\\'t uncommon for a player to blame you for their own mistakes & then report you. Example, seen people solo tower diving or jungling alone in the enemies territory & as soon as they die they blame everyone else. The time when you\\'re most likely to receive a report is when your team has a party of 3 or 4 people, and you\\'re the outsider; in this case, the abuser won\\'t want to blame their friends so it is easier to blame the stranger. So point of this paragraph is to highlight that remaining in a bad match, doesn\\'t always save you from the punishment system & it highlights that there is nothing \"casual\" about unranked as a result.\\n\\nThis is a free game, so there isn\\'t much risk in trying it, but there are much better games out there.\\n\\nUPDATE: Turbo mode was added and although matches are half the time, this isn\\'t enough. The US servers are still dominated by people who don\\'t live in the US, and don\\'t speak English. We need servers with regional lockout & ping limits. Does not have to be for all gamemodes, and can be an option you select in matchmaking, but it must be done.\\n\\nGame has severe performance issues, crashing.\\n\\nReport system & punishment pool are still flawed and doing more harm than good.\\n\\nThis game is several years old, and the devs have heard ALL of this over and over, they just don\\'t care. Avoid this game, even if it is free, it isn\\'t worth the time.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Edit January 24th 2021:\\nAfter a 3 years break I gave this a try again and I\\'m proud to admit it: this game stopped being a terrible whirlwind of frustration and toxicity (although it\\'s still lurking there every now and then) and is now actually enjoyable and doesn\\'t feel like a total waste of your life if you play it in moderation.\\n\\nOriginal \"review\"\":\\nIf I spent those 700 hours learning knitting, I guess I\\'d be pretty good at knitting by now.\\nInstead I spent 700 hours doing this coprophilia and I still can\\'t last hit.\\n\\nEDIT 7/5/2017:\\nMy last year with this game was an endless cycle of:\\n1. remember the good things\\n2. install dota\\n3. have the most frustrating game in my life\\n4. uninstall dota\\nJust don\\'t even start.\\n\\nEDIT 2016:\\n  On a serious note, DOTA is a great competitive team game that is really fun to play and really fun to watch.\\n  BUT it has one of worst communities I\\'ve come across. Public games are a pure pain 90% of time because of this. I spent most of my 1000+ hours with my friends and even if there was 3 of us, there was still 2 other people on our team who were capable more than enough to ruin the game completely. I am not talking about skill level or gameplay habits but about conduct and morales.\\n  Your matches will be repeatedly ruined by idiotic people who can\\'t behave themselves, refuse to cooperate and are not manly enough to admit defeat. No matter how good DOTA is at its core, the time I spent playing such matches was vastly irritating and I am never getting that time back. \\n\\nHere\\'s a list of some pretty standard stuff that you\\'ll be dealing with EVERY. GOD*AMN. MATCH:\\n \\n -very rarely anyone ever commends you for the good plays you manage (that is, if they even notice).\\n\\n -if you screw something up, misclick or miss a spell, it\\'s gonna be pointed out immidiatelly by your     team and they will talk sh*t to you and shove it into your face for the rest of the match.\\n\\n -should you ever raise constructive criticism against someone, no matter how kind words you use, that person will most likely not only refuse to learn from it, they will also start to actively look for any tiniest flaws on your side trying to look more pro than you.\\n\\n -there is no such thing as asking for something. People just expect you to do something and then   they talk sh*t to you that you didn\\'t do it.\\n\\n -people will constantly blame you for their own mistakes. It will mess with your head even though it\\'s obvious the fault is on their side.\\n\\n -people will start talking sh*t to you out of the blue and refuse to tell you the reason why they\\'re doing it. If they\\'re total fuc*ing idiots, they will just tell you to watch replay.\\n\\n -you will be constantly reminded to uninstall dota.\\n\\n -a teammate will seem completely oblivous to your attempts to communicate with them but will gladly say \"noob\" when you comment on the fact that they don\\'t cooperate.\\n\\n -if you\\'re just having a bad day and your performance is outright bad, your whole team will start a f*cking crusade against you. They will start talking the enemy team into reporting you and they will very likely sabotage your gameplay in various ways.\\n\\n -at a certain point when victory seems too far, some of these ret*rds just have a breakdown and will remain afk and just move occassionally to not be auto-kicked by the game, effectively ruining the match and wasting time of anyone on their team who actually wants to play.\\n\\n -if there is no one specific to blame for losing, they will just throw it on the person with the lowest K/D. Preferably a healer support hero who rarely gets any kills at all.\\n\\n  This list is just a tip of the iceberg. I am constantly losing faith in humanity because of people in this game. If you ever meet someone who doesn\\'t qualify for this list, send them a big hug from me, because it\\'s those people who keep me playing somehow. \\n  With this in mind, I cannot possibly encourage you to have your precious time ruined by terrible cowardly people who don\\'t understand that griefing and destructive criticisim aren\\'t helping anything and can only make matters worse.',\n",

You will not slowly rise in rank nor will you sink . . . because 19 in 20 games are decided by hurt feelings or disconnections.

Probably no one gonna play it in 5 years. Even CS GO seems better.\\n\\n[b]Thoughts now:[/b] \\n Well..I found out that this is a game where you have to actually think,it's awesome,I found out there are bunch of tactics and strategy to use while playing, a lot of results depend on you and on a team( not ONLY on the team ) , game gets better , pool prizes get bigger , gets more fun. \\nI personally prefer CS Go,as there the results mostly depend on you,where you yourself can kill everyone and not blame the team for losing,while in Dota it's all mostly depends on the team, but still,with good team this is kind of like chess game.\\nOften frustrating, but even more often is enjoyable.\\nIf you are able to manage your time( so you won't sink half of your free time here), good game to spend your time in.\\n\\nP.S Remember guys, 99.9% of you won't be pro-gamer professional money maker playing this, it's a waste of time in overall sense and there is no point wasting hundreds of hours to become super pro and just get nothing from it except fun spent time.\\n\\nEDIT: August 23\\n\\nI actually found CS GO more fun to waste time in, the main problem of Dota that it's too much team dependent , if people on your team don't do well( and this happens very often ) than the game is ruined, and 1 hour of playing is often quite wasted because of this, while in CS I can only blame myself I die , or I can kill everyone in a round by myself .\\nCharacters are equal, so 1v1 is equal , where in Dota it's often not -due to characters  being separated on support/carry/mix and you whether need to be carry to kill enemy or ask for help.\\nAlso , I didn't think this would be the case at all, but it is harder for me to play CS ,which I played even 10 years ago(it just looks simple , until you play competitive, with all the use of grenades and stuff), then it is DOTA 2 when I just started in 2019.\\n\\nEdit after August 23:\\nCs GO is quite trashy waste of time, so I uninstalled it after some time playing too\\n.!.\",\n",

My hand-eye coordination and strategical planning skills have never been better, but now I'm hopelessly addicted to this digital heroin that pointlessly pits me against other addicts in a quest to find who can throw more of their life into pointlessly developing an intricate understanding of what must be the most complicated game of all time. Like all human communities, there exist both garbage scumbags and angelic meta-friends, and one mustn't tilt lest the balance sway in the enemies favor. You are a guaranteed failure at this game for the first year and a half too, just FYI. GIve it a go, its probably not as bad for you as heroin.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"After 2100 Hours of Playing this game, my recommendation is to never even try to play the game. It is filled with toxic players, racist players, and trolls. The problemis that Valve  will never fix this or ban them. Dont let anyone rope you in to play this game. True you will enjoy it till your life is dominated by abusive players, racist players, feeders and  trolls. I have never seen a game where a player just jump right inb and his paired with way more experienced players and doesnt even know what his ultimate power does, if it was just that it would have being fine but no you have to deal with racists and bigots that harass you because of who you are. I cannot count how many times my religion has made someone follow me about and call me names till I disconnected from the game because the harassment was too much, and guess what valve punished me for leaving a game where I was being harassed. VALVE supports racists and trolls. Don't even get me started on the Ranked system that is no different that littered with cheaters and toxic elements, it is also rigged to benefit their so-called PRO PLAYERS. TAKE MY ADVICE AND PLAY ANOTHER GAME. This game is bad for your health. VALVE WILL NOT FIX THE MATCHMAKING DONT DECEIVE YOURSELF. And Oh it takes 30mins to queue up for a game\",\n",

It is these characteristics, however, to make it a game unique depth and the potential rewards that can give a feeling of \"conquest\", actually earned a high price, and therefore real, tangible. All this long to find, in a relatively short time, a team more or less sets of people with whom it is possible to cooperate and communicate effectively, since the nature of the deep tactical gameplay makes it almost impossible to be accompanied by casual players and hope to derive mutual benefit and fun, especially in the long term. Now that DOTA 2 is available for all, the challenge of numbers with the main competitor League of Legends can begin. In the face of a rock starting even steeper, Valve from its experience exceptionally balanced and truly free from the need to open your wallet, not counting infrastructure for the live broadcast of the games can be the envy of every Another developer MOBA. If the work on accessibility will continue in the right direction, this could make the confrontation one of the most exciting and interesting in recent years.',\n",

       "  'review': \"For the first dozen hours or so, you'll be bombarded with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. But if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth, a ridiculously generous free-to-play model, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it.\\n\\nEven so, Dota 2 remains a place where strangers scream at one another for making mistakes, where hostility has been entrenched by parts of the community as the norm and even desirable. It is certainly not the only game that has this problem, but it can feel unusually intense: perhaps because Dota 2 forces strangers together for so long, or makes them depend on one another so much. The same pressures that make this such a remarkable experience with friends can make it hellish, too, and after six years I couldn't assure you that this is going change. Dota 2 is one of my favourite games of all time, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend playing it solo until you know what you're getting yourself into.\\n\\nDota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably won’t suit you if you’re looking to play casually. There’s a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, there’s a wild and exciting variety of play here that’s unmatched, even by its peers. It’s a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that it’s completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isn’t just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Ah where to begin. Dota(the classic Dota as warcraft3 map) is one of the best MOBA games ever created. Who am i kidding \"one of the best\", it is the best. Played so much of it at internet cafes back then when internet cafes didnt even have internet(on LAN) or at home against AI until dial up internet was introduced. Experimentation with heroes, items, strategies when there were no premade builds nor information on how and what the professionals do made it all perfect. It was gaming heaven. 10/10\\nAfter many years Dota 2 came out, I joined the game a bit later after the beta testing. It was a good recreation of the original. With friends we transitioned to it. Playing was fun and slowly the professional scene was getting created. And so meta was created. \\nPeople had heroes they should pick and items to build, any experimentation would be punished, this led to a major current problem the role system. Roles should not be fixed for example- Support when position 4 is someone who roams the map or jungle, Offlane is not a second carry, it is a tank, someone who can survive being solo on the lane and tank for the team later. Current meta decided what is correct and what is not. There is no roam for experimentation. Possible solution-removing roles and stop relaying on meta. \\nThe most important issue is the community. Over the years it become more and more toxic to the point it changes you to become toxic as well and then you click play button without any enjoyment for the game as you already now that you will have to deal with toxicity the next game. Possible solution-wait until capitalism finally dies and people get happier in their real lives, that happiness will project on the game.\\nThe third problem is the concept of the game where if you get a feeder,toxic person or a troll he can single-handedly lose you the game and a single player can not win the game by himself. Possible solution- There should be a system for detecting behavior in game and for example granting experience/gold boost to the unlucky team.\\nAs a follow up from the previous problems is a problem of solo/party. if you are playing solo games are luck based- All problems above and a high skill difference as a consequence of declining player base.Possible solution- it will fix itself when the former problems are solved.\\nAlso if you have 4 friends to fill the party you can mitigate last 2 problems but in time you might lose those friends as a result of the competitive/meta and unequal skill matchmaking design.\\nAs for the new players i do not recommend this game to them. Why? All the problems above and a steep learning curve. As a conclusion: This is an addictive game which in its current state will probably make you lose thousands of hours becoming an average player, making you more and more toxic over time or at least ruining many of your days. All that for just 1% of time where you get actual enjoyment. After all this said i still have some hope for this game.',\n",

       "  'review': \"This game has nothing to offer anybody. There is no quality fun you cannot get more quickly and efficiently elsewhere. This is an addiction which reduces your productivity, attention span, and free-time. You are becoming more bitter, narrow-minded, haughty, and old. Quit now and delete this game. There is nothing here but slow, lonely suicide.\\n\\nPeople do not have fun here. Players do not communicate succesfully with one another, they nitpick mistakes with witty remarks and mock each other. Nobody is interested in the truth; people are battling for fleeting moments of superiority. Players are loud jackasses who tumble into one argument after another, anxiously waiting for you to respond to ensure they keep the last word every time. A fair and balanced match is one in ten thousand, and no matter how hard you filter those matchmaking options you are still searching for diamonds in a garbage dump.\\n\\nThis game is not making you happy. You are not having fun. You are not gathering fun experiences to tell, learning, or growing as a person. Instead you rage every thirty minutes and are occasionally spurred to rage quitting by retarded russian teammates who believe they won the Cold War. You are addicted to readily available fun and pressure free social interaction. This game is slowly poisoning you with misogyny, anti-semitism, narcissism, a false dichotomy surrounding pro-gamers, and insecurity.\\n\\nI'm not telling you to get good. I'm not telling you to go outside. I'm not even telling you to make friends. Just quit DOTA. Do anything else.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I don\\'t care about Dota 2. Never did, but I always loved to play as the Paladin in Warcraft 3 (Reign of Chaos and The Frozen Throne) in battle.net solo ladder matches. If you played ladder in that game, you know that nobody selects the Paladin as their main or even secondary hero. I obviously lost a lot, but I had fun. Then the custom maps (5 corridors, footmen rush, dota, etc) came out where I could play as a single hero. I enjoyed those maps a lot since I could victoriously play as the Paladin. So when Dota 2 came out and it had the Paladin in it, I was all in!\\n\\nIn all my hours played in Dota 2 I only played as Omniknight. I already stopped playing this game since it was time to move on, but I couldn\\'t just leave my Paladin without saying goodbye so I created my Omniknight guide where I just opened my soul and let the juices flow. That Dota 2 Steam guide is now on page 1 (out of 4000 pages) of \"Top Rated All Time\". http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=625610142 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2760346279 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885456587 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885990279 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2251291022',\n",

       "  'review': 'I started playing Dota 2 around 2 years ago, at that time it was still at Beta and I would never have expected that this game would greatly affect my life. When I started I did not have any experience and much expectation of the game, due to the genre - it was all new to me, however before trying out the game it took my friends awhile to get into the game because I did not like the fact the game was still at Beta and at that time I was detesting its predecessor “DotA” due to the fact the gameplay was confusing which it turned me off and also the graphics was years outdated without even trying the game out. I was able to give its successor a chance when a friend of mine introduced the ESports scene within the game community of the genre. I was hooked due to I never have expected that a type of sport has been running for almost a decade which it has been under my radar. I personally was not a fan for Sports in general although after hearing about ESports is completely change my perspective on both of the game and sports. \\n\\nESports is a term for organized video game competitions, especially between professional. It is known as competitive gaming, professional gaming and cyber sport. The most common video game genres associated with electronic sports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena. Generally “Dota 2” would fall under the MOBA genre due to it consists of session-based online multiplayer matches, in which two teams of five players attempt to destroy their opponents\\' fortified strongholds known as Ancients. Each player controls a \"Hero\" character and, over the course of an individual game, focuses on improving their Hero\\'s abilities, acquiring items, and fighting against the other team.\\n\\n“Welcome to Dota, You Suck”, is a well-known proverb within the DotA Community, which is aimed at new player. In fact is the truth, especially for new to the genre, for the first dozen hours or so, you will be showered with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. On the other hand if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It\\'s an achievement owed to uncompromising depth and complex gameplay, being a free-to-play, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it.\\n\\nThat said, you should not expect to have fun on your first day playing... or even your first week. It is due to the unforgiving players within your team which expects you to do your job flawlessly although it is impossible even pro players can make a mistake, however there’s a method of this insanity. In order survive in Dota 2 you need to understand every single hero and mechanics and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold they’d get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities.\\n\\nThere are 102 Dota 2 heroes (and counting) each consist of different abilities and mechanics and serves different roles from each other. For example Riki, is an melee Agility hero in which when he acquire his ultimate at level 6 he becomes permanent invisible, which is an obvious choice for most of new player. However there are various ways to counter an invisble heroes, this can be done by purchasing either a “Dust of Apperance, “Sentry Wards” or “Gem of true sight”, anyone can purschase these item during a game, making the game more balanced. In addition some heroes has an ability to track an invis heroes for a short period of time.\\n\\nIn conclusion, DOTA 2 is fun and challenging and deeply rewarding unlike other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. It has clear visuals and more balance gameplay unlike League of Legends and has an incredible longevity',\n",

       "  'review': 'Dota 2 is a game that requires practice, patience and a positive attitude to succeed. While the basic fundamental principles of the game remain unchanged from its earliest incarnation, the meta and dynamic is constantly and ever-changing. Of all the major RTS/MOBA games on the market, Dota 2 provides the most challenging, in depth and unique experience.\\n\\nIf you dream of \"going pro\" then Dota 2 is a game where anyone can become an e-sports legend if they\\'ve got the skill to back it up. Major tournaments including the annual International tournament have open qualifiers with no rank/MMR requirement. All you have to do is beat the competition.\\n\\nDota 2 matches can get spicy. Don\\'t get caught up in the negativity, mom-bashing and cancer-wishing. While you\\'re angrily banging away at your keyboard, the other team is winning. Also, Dota 2 isn\\'t a game that holds your hand.

       "  'review': \"If you can get past the initial learning curve and burden of knowledge the game puts on you, then DOTA2 can be extremely rewarding.\\n\\nAs far as most MOBAs are concerned, this one has a good blend of strategy and relfexes that rewards those who can use both to their advantage. The gameplay is, as a result, solid, and every sessions provides new opportunities for fun and strategy.\\n\\nThe UI is a little underpopulated, however, and doesn't explain much. learning how to do some of the functional things, like leaving a game that's safe to leave, or muting people, or reporting people, are not super intuitive: you have to dig. Furthermore, the options available, though very powerful and plentiful, are not explained super well. As a result, it's important to toy around with your settings a bit, which can be a hassle.\\n\\nAs far as the F2P model goes, it's pretty fair: you can play the whole game without needing any of the micro transactions. The only thing they do is customize your aethetics, and happily not to an extreme extent. \\n\\nBecause of this, the game has a really unified look despite all the different items your characters can wear. This might dissuade people from buying them, because some of the items are barely even visible.\\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone with a hankering for a challenge. The game is NOT easy, but it is worthwhile and a lot of fun once you get a hang of things. Veterans of the genre will find a lot to like.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Dota 2 has been a huge part of my life ever since 2012 when I built my first gaming PC. Soon after I started playing pc all of the games I thought I wanted to play melted away as I was greeted with the monolithic game Dota 2. There's so much that can draw you in initially including great graphics, amazing sound design, all characters are fully voiced and have their own unique personalities while also being free, sweet particle effects, and satisfying mechanics. The game has a massive hero list and practically an infinitely high skill ceiling, also while being an extremely basic game at it's core. I love this game, even with all of it's flaws and the incredibly bumpy ride that Gaben and co. made us endure along the way. Even with all of that I honestly believe that right now in 2019 Dota is in the best iteration that it has ever been, but in the worst way possible, and for that reason I cannot and would not recommend this game. \\n\\nLet me elaborate, the game that is Dota 2 is in my opinion in its current best state but everything that surrounds the game itself is in it's worst. The UI, the battlepasses/microtransactions, matchmaking, and the community have all pretty much gone to crap. It's a shame because I am really liking what Icefrog has been able to accomplish with the anomaly that is source 2. Somehow he's been able to make it work and I am still blown away every time when I load up into a game, that is if it ever happens. \\n\\n\\nVisuals - 10/10\\nSound - 10/10\\nGameplay - 10/10\\nIceFrog - 10/10\\nMatchmaking - 💩/10\\nCommunity - Сука блять/10\\nSteam - Updating Steam Coordinator/10\\n\\nDota 2 - Not Recommended\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]Updated review, after clocking 500 hours and understanding what the game is about[/h1]\\n\\nDota 2. A game with a massive learning curve that requires nothing apart from your game knowledge and good habits to excel at.\\n\\nDon't get into this game if you're not willing to learn a lot or sacrifice plenty of your time.\\n\\nOnce you reach a high skill level, you understand the game at its core and you also find the right people to play with this game is the most enjoyable game you can possibly play. That is if you have the patience to get there.\\n\\nThe community is great overall, the game is flawless. Valve is doing a great job with this one.\\n\\nCompetitive scene is the healthiest I've seen, and I've watched countless competitive matches. So damn entertaining.\\n\\nJust look at this!\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HBr1EGX1I\\n\\nNow what has changed ever since I written the review back in 2013?\\n\\nWell, the new client has been ported that offers better things on the interface and support aspect and brings in new things like a slew of Custom Games you can play apart from Dota2. This game started originally as a mod for Warcraft III and I'm happy to see it has gone full circle to such an extent that the original W3 can be made entirely in the Dota2 client.\\n\\nAs a flagship Valve game, you can expect bright things in the future, as the competitive scene flourishes.\\n\\nThe only answer is: Do you want to play a moba?\\n\\nIf you like:\\n- free games\\n- polished games\\n- playing with a team\\n- playing with friends\\n- cosmetics & spending money for them\\n- hard games\\n- e-sports \\n\\nIf you are okay with:\\n- spending a lot of time playing games\\n- learning a lot of complicated things\\n- getting yelled at by russians\\n\\nThen Dota2 is a game for you.\",\n",

You'll need another 100 for an adept knowledge of the characters and their skills along with item builds. From here your looking at like the 600 hour mark to start being efficient at the game and making choices dependent upon draft, counters etc and then actual knowledge of placement and all that stuff begins to take hold. You'll need about another 400 hours of learning all this stuff before you can actually start playing decently and then you still end up in games with the literal brainless spawn of what I can only assume is the result of two meth addicts accidentally letting the fetus they pawned for more gear, end up back in their care after the dealer grew tired of using it as a personal ashtray and door stop for a solid 6 months because their communications skills resemble that of a mute that must have had their throat cancer removed and as such can no longer speak and has the mechanical ability of a potato.

       "  'review': \"Because it's a competitive game I would like to talk about my experiences in ranked matches.\\n\\nSolo Ranking System\\n\\nIn SOLO ranked matches you have to play with a TEAM where their own mistakes may lower your rating (SOLO MMR).\\nI was wondering all the time, is it too hard to turn those matches into 1v1 solo mid?\\nI patiently watched how my team ruined every single match so far.\\nMaybe it's the system or it's finally time to blame the team after 5,5 hours. I don't know, what do you think?\\n\\nTeam Ranking System\\n\\nTeam ranked matches are actually the same if you don't have premade team.\\nMatchmaking does not care about in game hours so experienced players may match inexperienced players.\\nFortunately your TEAM MMR is changing in these matches.\\n\\nI can't recommend this game because of its ranking systems. I have written this review because the only thing you can enjoy in this game would be a high MMR if you think you can get it on these systems. This game was my favorite before the ranking systems have arrived long before the Reborn update. However at this stage of game there is no more DOTA 2 enjoyment. You may enjoy this game as an usual MOBA or you may not.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Honest feedback / observations - Dota 2 - 7.00\\n\\nI was watching the eg vs newbie game last night, and I\\'ve honestly never been that uninterested in a pro game, and this is coming from someone who really enjoys watching them, almost to the point of enjoying it more than playing .. It was hard to pinpoint one specific reason why I disliked the viewing experience, there are so many changes to this once great game it\\'s really hard to put the feelings into plain text, its almost unrecognizable from previous versions. Nevertheless, I tried to honestly reflect on my thoughts and have covered some of the issues I\\'ve noticed and that the caster pointed out as well, see below. \\n\\nAt face value, and for me personally, the game seems to have generally lost what made it so special to begin with - it was different than the other MOBA\\'s, it had its own unique identity and old school feel. I feel that this is due to the very gradual changes/improvements that patches have brought over the years, never straying too far from the core gameplay. Change is good and inevitable in many cases, but this isn\\'t change, this is almost a new game. The game feels dumbed down/too easy in some respects (6x runes/talent trees/less emphasis on item progressions/item countering/arcady feel) but also too complicated in some respects (horrible pathing/lame fighting areas with too many stairs and jungle juke spots/extra towers in the jungles/small hud that fs up my focus/vital info being hidden or taken out completely etc etc etc). Basically what most people are saying on here is how I am feeling as well - if you\\'re one of the people who puts their arms up and says go into more detail, please just ask, I would be happy to elaborate. \\n\\nNow... The caster, who has been playing basically since dota inception (and was also once a beta tester for icefrogs patches) kept noting how terribly \"boring\" the update is, and compared many of the changes to games like LOL/HOTS. I personally found it refreshing to hear someone with loads of experience break down some of the shortcomings of this new patch as not many high level dota players have as of yet (why would they bite the hand that feeds I guess). There were several specific points made as to why the new patch has fallen short and I wish I could remember exactly what all of his points were. Nevertheless, one thing that stood out was when the caster spoke about the new runes, which he disliked very much. This sort of sums up what he said: The new runes effectively force players to go to point X at time X, and if you don\\'t you\\'re missing out. It feels like a forced meta, and that there is now a very specific formula to the game that promotes less creativity. Support players can hangout in jungles to collect runes etc most of the early game, pick up their talent tree exp or gold bonus or w.e and then start 5 manning. In general, he felt that whoever has the better lineup tends to win, and thought that many games were effectively won or lost at the draft (obviously there\\'s more to it but I thought it was an interesting statement). He also absolutely ripped into the new HUD - however i think most players tend to agree (even the ones who call out the \\'whiners\\') that the HUD sucks and will most likely continue to be overhauled. He also mentioned that, although there is not much public outcry from the pros, that behind closed doors many of the pro players are extremely disappointed with the new direction of the game. He covered many other issues that I do not have the time/energy/memory to touch on but as you can tell..I care deeply for this game. I am not the type of person to come on forums to talk ♥♥♥♥/complain but I felt forced to in this case.. I have not abandoned the game yet as I think that is a premature knee jerk reaction, however, I am abstaining from the current state of the game until (I hope) changes are made.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Here is my problem with the recent addition of DotA Plus: Valve openly condemned the use of similar programs in the past, programs like DOTABUFF Plus and a similar program on OverWolf, and I believe they have threatened to or have given temporary bans for people caught using such programs (don't quote me on that last line, only heard rumors about the bans). This was a few months ago, they vocalized this in one of their newsletters. And now, all of a sudden, they want to ride the hype train by offering a paid version of what players can already get for free (with the addition of accesories to try and justify the price). \\n\\nThere is nothing intrinsically wrong with DotA Plus in such a way that it offers an unfair advantage - it doesn't increase your damage or anything, it just gives (rarely) useful insight into hero drafting, and that's it. If people feel inclined that they spend money for a computer to tell them how to draft their heroes, jokes on them because again, they are free versions available. In fact, you don't even need a program - what these programs do is basically give you a small, fast windowed version from websitess like DOTABUFF that carry all the statistics such as winrates between heroes and common hero laning. Theoretically you can just alt-tab to the website and type in everything, it's just inconvenient because it takes longer to switch windows and type in a timely manner during the drafting phase. These programs eliminate the inconveniences of alt-tabbing and typing, it automates the search-up of heroes and pops up the results in a wondow. That's it. People have gotten punished for using these draft helpers not long ago (again, only rumored that people got temp-bans) and now Valve decides to turn a blind eye on what they have been doing and make us pay for the same type of program because they added some cosmetics.\\n\\nIn other words, Valve banned people who used these free programs because it was 'cheating' (not really), and then come out with the same program but in order to use it, you need to pay by monthly subscription (with hero accessories). Scam if I ever heard one. Not supporting this behavior, too many games get ruined because of actions like this, World of Tanks for one example.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'With over 110 heroes to choose from, Dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of all the games available on Steam.  Many players find that even after 100+ hours of gameplay, they feel incompetent at the game.  While this is probably Dota 2\\'s greatest downfall, it is also the aspect that makes the game as great as it is.  There is just so much to learn in this game, that it will provide fans with countless hours of playtime.\\n\\nVerdict: Dota 2 is an extremely difficult game, and that is what makes it most rewarding.  Yes, the amount of time it will take a new player to become even an \"average\" player may take well over 100 hours.  However, if you are can overcome its steep learning curve and are looking for a game long term, DOTA 2 may just be the best game you can currently find - and it is free.',\n",

       "  'review': 'After 3k hours of playing basically every style of Dota 2 from Solo/Duo, 5-Stack, Battle-Cups, Community Modes etc.\\nI\\'m finally writing a review (my first one on Steam tho).\\n\\nThe Idea of the Game is amazing. A 5v5 Online Teambased Game with lots of variety is just pure fun for me, but there\\'s the first of some problems I\\'ve had over the last 6 years with the game. The game is Teambased.\\n\\nSome now will say \"The Game isn\\'t Teambased it\\'s most likely on you...\" etc. Well I didn\\'t say It\\'s entirely on my Team. It is Teambased and Winning without a good Team on your own is in most ways not possible.\\n\\nAnother Problem I\\'ve had is the experience with Low Priority Queue. (I don\\'t know if the Low Prio Queue still exists since I didn\\'t play for a year but still). Every Power Failure, every Internet Failure, every GAME you FAIL to load in ends up in Low Priority Queue. Up to 5 Games... Which was really annoying since you had to win these Games and the \"Teambased factor\" didn\\'t help me out there.\\n\\nOne of the other problems I had with starting Dota is that you are just getting overwhelmed with information. You\\'ll just get stomped on for countless of hours until you know what to do, since there isn\\'t as many social media content like LoL (League of Legends) has, where you can learn the game from.\\n\\nAll in All even tho I\\'m not even playing the Game anymore. I would say it was worth the experience. I had lots of fun with my friends including my best friend (Officer QT aka. \"QntQ\", love u bro), but in the end I\\'m just not having fun anymore being stuck in low elo.',\n",

However, the Battle Pass and the crowd-funding prize pool are still here. And I am surprised how Valve is still able to keep up with their monetising model in Dota 2, showing how genius the system is. The prize pool is no less than less year\\'s. Plus they even keep up with the quality contents; three arcanas, two hero personas, tons of skins, all in this year battle pass. Plus theyalso  added the long-awaited \"Guild\" feature to the game.\\n\\n\\n[h1]- 2018[/h1]\\nRecent update added \"Dota Plus\" (optional monthly subscription) replacing the old Major Battlepass system. I think it\\'s become a little more pay to win, but only very slight. It gives you more detailed information, expanded the fight summary, and suggestions (common sense). For instance, in the picking phase and during the game such as team combination, which skill to level up first, which items to buy. Moreover, there is lifetime hero progression for each hero, you gain exp to level up each time you play and complete a hero quest as additional purpose to play. And also, now with reward system that lets you claim rewards for you favorite heroes. \\nI think it is a good feature since if compared to the old battlepass system, it\\'s cheaper overrall the progressions and rewards that don\\'t expire like in the old battlepass system.  \\n\\nI feel like the new hero progression for Dota Plus players encourages players to spam thier favorite heroes to get leveled up (which can be good or bad).\\n\\n[h1]- 2017[/h1]\\nNominating this for The \"Haunts My Dreams\" Steam Award 2017. 4,000 hrs of playtime and it starts to change my everyday thinking... yeah, why not? I have been playing Dota 2 since 2014. Overall, I think it\\'s good since I still play it from time to time.\\nAlways think of it like Basketball or football. 5 players versus other 5 with weapons, magic sticks, flying donkeys, and the shops that sell them.  Each player pick different hero and role from 100+ heroes pool. Then you start playing pushing/earning money, growing strong, and buy items to help you and your team reach the other team\\'s base at the corner called the Ancient at the corner of the map easier and all. What complex here is how can break through the opponent team\\'s defense, their strategies, and heroes.\\n\\nWould recommend anyone to give this game a try since it\\'s free to play. Arcade modes are fun as well and less intense.\\n\\nBest to play with friends... suppose so\\nAre they nice? If so you\\'ll have hella fun.\\n[/quote]',\n",

       "  'review': 'First and foremost, I would like to thank Steam for giving me a way to call out all raging idiots blaming others. Steam <3 Thank you for all your support! Check out my Dota 2 Stats, Im fucking awesome. Following my simple guide, you will be on your way to dealing with baddies and becoming awesome, like me.\\n\\nOne of the worst communities ever, its not even the fact that they are obnoxious, annoying or racist. Its the fact that they so willingly blame others, they fail to improve their own gameplay after hours and hours of experience. The people who talk the most are quite literally the worst players. \\n\\nPro Tip: Mute them and tell them you muted them so they begin type less and focus on playing. The idiots spouting the worse non-sense are utter garbage and there are too many. \\n\\nHow to spot a raging idiot, preparing themselves for full emotional breakdown.\\n\\n\"BUY WARDS\" - Idiot who feeds mid. Dies again with two wards...\\n\\n\"SHOULD HAVE CALLED MISSING WTF\" - Jackass who dove towers and lost a 1v1\\n\\n\"Insert Racist Comments\" - Raging Idiot Bat Signal\\n\\n\"1 v 1 me mid\" - This guys inferiority complex is meme levels\\n\\n\"SaD yOu dIdNt LEaRn aNytHing fRoM pLaYing\" - Actual idiot, implying you learn from games? wtf lol dude? This is why drugs are for losers.\\n\\nPro Tip #2: A particularly good way to deal with ragers is when they inevitably feed, just type \"lol\" it sparks tremendous reactions between these fumbling jackasses. Sometimes it is better to humble them so they dont make themselves look dumb as hell the next time they decide to say stupid things.\\n\\nSometimes its better to let them ride it out because they simply cannot help themselves. I found out from my friends they will frequently move onto another subject matter when they realize senpai is not noticing them :(\\n\\nPro Tip #3: Have fun, dont let these raging morons ruin the game for you like they did me. If you follow Pro Tips 1 & 2, the reactions to the ragers is priceless, it demolishes their spirit and will think twice about their redherring tactics and actually l2p and git gud.\\n\\nExtra: Had one guy messaging me for several weeks and creating different accounts in order to throw racial slurs. He checked my profile, saw I had a Spanish flag, you can pretty much guess his favorite word.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena game from Valve. Dota 2 is the next installment from the previous game or mods Dota.\\n\\nDota 2 has the same gameplay as Dota. You pick your heroes, and then battle them in one map against another player. In the arena, as you kill and progress you will get coins and the use them to buy items to enhance your heroes on your current battle in the arena. You need to pick the right items each time you play as it will decide you will win the game or not. Dota 2 introduce item drops each time you finish a match online. There are many items in Dota 2 that can enhance your favourite heroes looks. Each item has rarity, the more rare the items, the more expensive it will become. Most items can be sold in the Steam Marketplace.\\n\\nDota 2 has far improved graphics from the previous game. Heroes are even more detailed and the arena has better view. All heroes ability effects are also improved, even the UI is better.\\n\\nDota 2 has many tournaments that you can participate. The biggest is \"The International\" Dota 2 tournament. Most tournaments can reward players with some rare items just by watching the tournaments.\\n\\nDota 2 is the best MOBA game yet. I recommend this.\\n\\nRating 9/10',\n",

Immortals can now be recycled using the same system as last year. For players that have already recycled immortals, the system will automatically back fill your progress on this replaced system and grant you additional immortal treasures as appropriate. Any rewards previously earned through the Sideshop will remain in player inventories, and if you still have gold and wish to continue rolling in the Sideshop, you can use the dota_show_sideshop command.\\n\\nAs part of this update we are also removing ticketing requirements for the Gauntlet\"\\n\\n\\n********************************Orginal review****************************************************************\\nThe latest battlepass and the update that came whit this, realy are destroying the game.\\nit is super unstable and it crashes so many times that you are not even able to finish a single game.\\n\\nAnd also when the battlepass was released al servers got overloade that you where not able  to que for a game for almost 8 hours, and  it also broke the steam shop.\\n\\nThe dev and qa teams of valve realy screwed up hard.\\nIt seems that valve has no review process on previous issues where they investigate and solve issue, because the problems are only getting worse.\\n\\nDont buy the battlepass(summer 2020), it looks like literly  burning money is giving more entertainment.\\n\\nVALVE GET YOUR ACT TO GETTER AND HAVE YOUR DEV TEAMS WORK ON THE BACKLOGS OF ISSUES THAT YOU ARE IGNORING NOW  FOR ALONG  TIME, REFACTOR CODE AND TEST TEST TEST!!!!',\n",

Yes, you can earn pseudo-random items that will bolster your chances of winning by farming neutral creeps. Some argue the game is determined by skill and knowledge and leaves little room for luck. But luck in my opinion adds the little bit of spice, like the randomness in a game of poker or the judgement of a referee.\\n\\nDespite the polarizing reception, patch 7.23 remains the most interesting patch compared to the history of changes implemented by prior updates. It adds an extra layer of complexity and creativity.',\n",

It does not give you anything nor will it ever give you anything.\\n\\nAnyone who is wise and can control themselves firmly; Sure you can play but my honest opinion would be to play this game with friends and that's about it.\\n\\nDon't waste your time on this game, it will slowly die as people won't have enough time to put into this game.\\n\\nIt's just way too time consuming, don't make the mistake that i myself did and many others out there.\\n\\nI am definitely going to quit this game, sure i had my fun and i loved the game at one point, deep down i still feel for it but that's because of something called addiction and the urge to become better and a higher rank. - Which is completely pointless and honestly does not mean anything; ばかです。。\\n\\n*Sigh*\\n\\nおねがいいい please don't play this game, absolute utter waste of time, kills a person mentally in so many ways and much much more.\\n\\nIf you play this game, play with caution and limit yourself, preferably with friends as it will be much more fun that way.\\n\\nAnyway, this is an honest opinion, people out there wasting 10k, 20k hours on this pile of shit of a game.\\n\\nDo yourself a favour and avoid this game and play Osu ;3\\n\\nでわさよなら！\\n\\nTime is priceless nor will you ever get it back...\\n\\nEdit: For people that think i'm low rank, i am rank 700 supp and rank 1.4k on core\\nIt's not about being being low mmr, it's about how i always fail to manage my time.\\nApparently i'm still going in this game xd\\n\\nTaking a 1 year break from this game just to focus on bettering myself and my life.\\nAfter a year 19/08/20 - 19/08/21 il be back here to decide whether or not this game is truly for me or not. \\n\\nMaybe street life was for me after all.\\n\\nStay blessed boys and keep that head up; times will get better\\n\\nEdit 2 : So i'm just working now at an amazing Market job and i'm just working my way up now which is solely based on results which is interesting since I'm going to push myself to the limit.\\n\\nSo far been good 2 weeks and it's just an update will keep updating along the year for myself to read within a year. I am doing so much better, i'm much more proud of myself and as to what i'm becoming, the discipline, focus and mindset is all getting better.\\n\\nI love Dota but sometimes we all gotta make moves that matter. \\n\\nPeace for now\",\n",

I recommend this game for everyone who is looking to waste his time insted of doing something more useful even if it was only staring at the screen.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Dota 2 is a colossus of a game for which you could write an endless review, if you talked about every aspect individually, although most people who play the game would probably focus on the competitive nature, balancing and things like that. From the outside it might seem like this super elitist game that is very hard to get into. There is a truth in all of that, but in my review I want to focus on one aspect of Dota 2 that is rarely talked about and in my opinion underappreciated, and that's the presentation. Every character in Dota 2 is so much better written and voiced than most triple A games. The heroes don't fill the usual cliche roles, they have their unique personality and simply listenening to the heroes speak, their banter etc. is extremely enjoyable for me. But a huge part of the presentation is also the sound design and the vfx, which not only makes each ability feel impactful and super fun to use, but even basic auto attacks feel extremely beefy, depending on the hero. The competition is not even close in this regard, and I'm not just talking about MOBAs.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Valve took a game that was wholesome and fun then turned it into a cash cow to be milked until it was dry as a dead husk. The psychological abuse that they encourage players inflict upon each other is unheard of in any other video game i've ever played. The report system is fully automated with no judge or jury and allows gutless trolls and griefers to run amok. They encourage petty 'eye for an eye' behavior instead of good sportsmanship and bully players into staying in a match that has them being battered over and over. They allow griefers to flame the living daylights out of you then when you finally snap and stick up for yourself, those same flamers have you repremanded by said automatic report system and YOU end up being the one who is punished. And what's worse is that those griefers get thanked by Valve for causing harm to other players.\\n\\nBut that's not all, people. No the abuse doesn't stop there. For a free to play game, this one will have you spending more money than its worth, dressing up your favorite heroes with expensive hats (some of which can only be won in Valve's treasure chest casino where they encourage children to gamble). \\n\\nDota has gone from a fun strategy game to a cesspool of greed and mental torture since Valve published its sequel and took over. And now that they're filthy rich they don't even develop their own games anymore. They take the lions share of the profits gained from treasure chests and give the artists who created those skins a mere pittance for their work. \\n\\nIf you thought EA was bad, Valve just took the title from them for most soulless games company.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Dota 2 is hard, but there\\'s a huge reward for those who commit. On the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) Defense of the Ancients modification for Warcraft III, now transferred into Valve\\'s Source engine. The game\\'s punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it\\'s worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.\\nIf you\\'re not aware of the basics of the burgeoning MOBA genre, two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map. \\n\\nEach team needs to work together with the goal of ultimately destroying a central structure--in Dota 2\\'s case, the Ancient--in the opposing team\\'s base. With most games lasting around the 40-minute mark, and occasionally edging past an hour, watching the enemy fortress dramatically crumble and sink to the ground feels like an exhilarating payoff.\\nAiding these two teams, named the Radiant and the Dire, are waves of AI assistants, called creeps. Batches of creeps spawn at 30-second intervals and charge merrily up the map\\'s three pathways. In the clumps of remaining land lies a jungle, where numerous AI opponents spawn, offering lucrative benefits to players who take them on successfully. Finally, and in a bid to stop both teams from simply marching into one another\\'s base, each team gets three powerful towers on each lane that easily shred through enemy players at the start of the game.\\n\\nYour individual ability to control and affect the rhythm of the game comes from how well you handle your hero. You mostly control a single unit in Dota 2, though there are exceptions: some heroes can summon controllable allies, such as bears, gargoyle babies, or wolves; one exceptionally versatile hero can split into three; and one item lets you take control of certain creeps. For each rule in Dota 2\\'s impressive house-of-cards design, there\\'s usually at least one character who completely ignores it, or finds a way around it via one of 130-odd items available from the in-match shop. For instance, try negating magic attacks with the black king bar, returning damage with the blade mail, or pounding out two ultimate abilities in quick succession with a refresher orb.\\n\\nThe aim for most players is to accumulate as much gold and experience as possible, with income being delivered mostly by scoring the killing blow on enemy creeps and players. It\\'s almost always easier to gang up on stray enemies as a group, which is why it\\'s rarely a good idea to run about on your own. Then it\\'s a case of splashing all your hard-earned money on some ultra-powerful items from the shop, while levelling up your base stats and abilities, and then clobbering the enemy team into submission via a few five-versus-five team fights. Rarely does it feel that simple, however.\\n\\nAt the time of writing, 102 of the original Dota\\'s 112 heroes have made their way into the sequel. Each hero has a handful of unique abilities and generally works best in a specific role, such as supporting other players as Omniknight, roaming around the map looking for opportunistic kills as Spirit Breaker, or evolving throughout the course of the game into an all-powerful vehicle of carnage and destruction as Phantom Assassin.\\n\\nThere\\'s only one map, unlike in many other MOBA titles, although Valve has not ruled out the addition of more over time, and has previously offered game-changing modes with seasonal events at Halloween and Christmas. But Dota 2\\'s single sprawling map sets itself apart from the competition by being larger, more intricate, and packed with greater detail than the rest of the genre. Unlike in League of Legends, the jungle area is riddled with far more tangling pathways, the lanes feature additional shops selling exclusive items, and savvy players are given more opportunities to use the environment to hide, flee, and ambush their opponents.\\n\\nThere are multiple layers of additional information that become increasingly relevant as you invest more time in the game. How do you effectively divide your forces? When should your team attempt to vanquish Roshan, the map\\'s most powerful creep? What are runes? What\\'s the significance of the fact that creeps get slightly stronger every seven and a half minutes?\\n\\nOften the game\\'s dizzying scale is seen as off-putting or simply too complex, but the truth of Dota is that it can be entertaining as a new player to just sit down and let all those extraneous factors play out around you. Getting down to the brass tacks of the game with a group of like-minded friends is a lot of fun: start by buying your characters\\' recommended items, try your best not to get caught out of position, and get into the habit of buying observer wards. And watch out for Riki.\\n\\nAs you\\'d expect from Valve, this is a beautifully presented game, with the Half-Life and Portal maker running victory laps around its competition in terms of UI, voice acting, and showing how to deftly add real personality to its characters. Only recently has the developer turned its attention to gently easing new players into the proceedings, however, and even now, mastering the basics feels like learning to swim by jumping in at the deep end. Efforts are being made to remedy this, though: right now there are a couple of tutorial levels, some well-designed AI bots, and a newbie playlist that restricts hero selection to just 20 of the most frequently picked characters. And with community-created hero guides now built directly into the game itself, Dota 2 is much easier to get started with than it has been in the past.\\n\\nPlay a match every evening for a couple of weeks, and you start to see how Dota 2\\'s wealth of disparate systems and mechanics combine into their own harmony, and you begin to understand how there are hundreds of elements that affect the game. Dota 2 is a tense war of accumulation and attrition. The biggest problem, which is coincidentally where the real excitement of the game lies, comes from struggling to process and interpret dozens upon dozens of mitigating circumstances while simultaneously trying to keep your cool.\\n\\nIt is a complicated and exhausting game, and for the first few weeks, it\\'s challenging just keeping up with the general rhythm of a match. But invest enough time into Dota 2, and you develop an almost unconscious ability to keep up with the game--performing actions such as sending the slightly fiddly in-game courier over to the faraway \"secret\" shop to get some rare items, for instance. After a couple of hundred hours of Dota 2, what once felt like spinning plates just happens automatically.\\n\\nWhile Dota 2 has transferred the core of the original Dota into a cleaner, modern engine, the fact remains that losing is uniquely painful. Death in Dota 2 not only gives your opponent money, but robs you of some of your own and leaves you waiting up to a minute to respawn. By the time you\\'ve trudged back across the game\\'s massive map--or spent money on a teleportation scroll--your opponent is now stronger and richer. Die two or three times in quick succession, which is easily done, and a match of Dota becomes a painful experience where you spend the next half hour getting bullied by an increasingly superior enemy. Other games in the genre have tried to mitigate this punishment, but Dota 2 positively revels in its complexities. The rich just get richer.\\n\\nGive it a go!',\n",

O lado estratégico do jogo parece infinito. Nunca há jogos iguais e podes escolher entre mais de 100 heróis sem pagar nada. Os gráficos são bacanos e o jogo corre em qualquer PC da marca Lidl. Conheci muita gente bacana a jogar isto. A maioria sofre de autismo mas é tudo boa gente.\\n\\nO jogo não termina quando o fechas. Por fora tens uma comunidade enorme de streammers e torneios de qualidade. Isto é um jogo que dá pica assistir. \\n\\nMelhores 0€ que já gastei na Steam. Go play!\\nMore addictive than tobacco, with more \"replay value\" than a Ana Malhoa sex tape and with mental health effects slightly equal to a stay in the sink house in the 1990s.\\n\\nTo be good in this game is not enough to master the mechanics and \"know the keys\", it is also necessary to have emotional intelligence to deal with 9 other people who sometimes seem to have the same desire to play that a member of the Islamic State has to to live.\\n\\nBut not everything is bad! The strategic side of the game seems endless. There are never equal games and you can choose between more than 100 heroes without paying anything. The graphics are cool and the game runs on any PC of the Lidl brand. I met a lot of nice people playing this. Most suffer from autism but are all good people.\\n\\nThe game does not end when the dates. On the outside you have a huge community of streamers and quality tournaments. This is a pica watch game.\\n\\nBest € 0 I\\'ve spent on Steam. Go play!',\n",

       "  'review': 'I play DOTA actively for 16 years. (From Dota Allstar v.5.84)\\n\\n\\n***For casual gamer whom never play a MOBA game***\\n\\nMOBA (eg: LoL, Smite, Paladins) or PvP games (shooters like CS-GO, Overwatch or Battle Royale games like PUBG/Fornite) is generally challenging yet satisfying to play with friends or friendly online strangers in general, you\\'ll receive satisfaction from learning, training, planning, execution, teamwork, friendship and progression.\\n\\nWith that being said, these kind of games are NOT casual-player-friendly. Dota 2 requires you a large amount of time invested in it to be able to experience a full development of overcoming weaknesses or excellent teamwork and progression. Casual players mostly will just get minimal sense of accomplishment and most likely end up having much stress and defeats, this game punishes casual-player harshly unless you truly do not care about getting good or win a match but if that is the case, you have many other games offer much more fun with the same given amount of time. You play Dota 2 mostly to challenge yourself, not really for fun.\\n\\n-------Casual players stop reading--------\\n\\n\\n\\n***For most of you whom have tried PvP shooters/MOBA and Dota 2 veteran***\\n\\n\\nYou are ready to get some challenges (aka i wanna get ♥♥♥♥ed up real bad! I\\'m ready! Bring it on!), but why Dota 2? You asked. And for returning veterans, is it worth it to come back?.... again?\\n\\nLook,\\n\\nI started playing Dota Allstar version 5.84 (what it used to be called) on Warcraft 3 November 2004 when one Healing Salve (in game hp potion) cost 400 gold. In 2020, it sounds crazy expensive (that potion cost 110 gold now) but back then 400 gold for 400 hp somehow seems reasonable. At the early time of Dota Allstar, there was no proper online platform for players to match up (only LAN games) but later it comes Battle.net, Garena etc. Players (mostly from China and SEA) were initially bond to this game by playing in local cyber cafes. Dota Allstar or Warcraft 3 were like a virtual playground for me and friends to enjoy and mess around. Later we even participated in some local tournaments. I am one of those players who witness the birth of MOBA eSport and follow along the journey from Dota Allstar to Dota 2 over the past decades and i am proud of it. As fun as a virtual playground sounds, an unregulated virtual playground is fundamentally not a playground. It is a survival of the fittest arena where stronger kids get to have most of the fun while weaker kids wanting to get stronger. Thus 80% of the Dota 2 players are not playing for fun, they are playing to get better at it, maybe for a sense of accomplishment like Dark Soul games yes but rarely for fun. Only 20% of the Dota players are playing mostly for fun.\\n\\nFor the game itself, it is just a map. A classic MOBA 3 lanes 5v5 hero battle map. The graphic are good for a 2D game, music are excellent and heros are free. A very large player base with the highest eSport tournament prize every year (it is not happening year 2020 due to COVID19). You can watch replay of all your matches and you can even watch your friend\\'s match on live, how fun. There are arcade mini games just like Warcraft 3 custom maps with decent player base as well.\\n\\nIf you are reading reviews on Steam you are not trying to find out the game itself, you can simply download the game and try it out it is free anyway. You are looking at reviews trying to find out whether this game is worth the commitment because you know the amount of time and effort that requires to get good. So my take on this after all these years playing, if you are into PvP games, you can choose any shooters or MOBAs but regardless of which game you actually play, they all give you the same emotional feedback. Sure every PvP games looks different, movement are different, match making system are different, music etc. But essentially they all gives you the same try hard get good feelings, the feeling of you identifying a weakness within yourself, figuring out how to improve it, trying out how to improve it and eventually overcomes that weakness are pretty satisfying. And PvP games generally gives you that. In fact, the more complex a game is, the more \"training\" to overcome your weakness you will find. Thus Dota 2 being the most difficult MOBA will constantly provide you with these invisible tasks to a point where it will overwhelms you then you will give up.... for a while. When you are a strong person whom likes improvement and wanna go somewhere in life, you will eventually come back. You are a sucker for this emotional drug! After all these years of playing, i don\\'t play it for the game itself anymore but for the attitude towards hardship, self control skills and empathy etc. Identify the problem and adapt by getting off your high horse and lead the comeback, adaptation like this doesn\\'t happen you never getting out of your rank prison.\\n\\nI know you come here to look for game review but ended up with edgy life related topic hahahahha but sadly, those unsexy skills are essential to succeed in modern society. If you really need an oversimplification of my point of view is that this game is like Chess. First, you play Chess for Chess, later you play Chess for yourself. At some point, the game itself isn\\'t that important anymore nor the fun but the lesson player can learn from his/her actions. What doesn\\'t kill you made you stronger and you can match and train everyday without the consequence of trying that exists in real life, how awesome. You get so much more than playing a game by investing in Dota 2. Every time you come back from quitting, you become a better person.\\n\\n\\n24/11/2004 - 18/09/2017\\nUpdated 27/06/2019\\nUpdated 18/08/2020\\n\\n\\n*In case you wondering why i only have 3k playtime. i played on LAN and battle.net from 2004-2008ish then played on Garena platform on and off till Dota 2 came out on Steam in 2013, on Steam i owned 5 accounts from 3 regions (EU west, SEA and Aus) due to change of residence.',\n",

The audience vibrated, drowning out the breathless voice of the narrators.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2238087547\\n\\nWithin seconds, the Alliance took advantage of the impossible, reversing a situation that could upset any other team. The next 20 minutes were filled with tension, and a small error in Na'Vi's position was enough for the opposing team to delay its defense and destroy, even with great resistance, the most important construction of the game. Players and fans celebrated one of the most exciting moments in the history of DotA 2, which, until then, had come a long way to that point.\\n\\nThe DotA concept was not born at Valve, much less the creators would imagine that they would be creating a new genre within games. With roots in Starcraft, the first games with the current molds of the MOBA (Massive Online Battle Arena) appeared in Aeons of Strife, a map created by fans and later ported to Warcraft III, receiving the main features that today DotA 2 presents.\\n\\nDotA Allstars, bringing together versions created by multiple players, has become increasingly successful. More than seven years passed before Valve started the project to free the game from the limitations of Warcraft III, updating the graphics and offering new features that until then were not possible in the Blizzard game.\\n\\nDotA 2 did not grow with a very intuitive proposal: two teams (Radiant and Dire) face each other on a map with three routes, and each player will choose a hero (among the 105 available) to be part of this advance. On the way, players will have to pass through enemy troops, towers and heroes, seeking to destroy the Ancient enemy located at the end of the routes. In this way, the player will be able to buy items and evolve skills like a typical RPG, but in a classic superior view of strategy games.\\n\\nUntil arriving free and definitely on Steam, the concept behind DotA had already come a long way and conquered thousands and thousands of fans. In this new stage, Valve brought more than resources to make life easier for players: it sought to improve the game to keep it challenging and stimulating for decades.\\n\\nDotA 2 is a game that may not please everyone, but that should be experienced by everyone. Its learning curve tending to the infinite captivates many players to continuous improvement, and its innovative formula and filled with elements of RPG and strategy are the characteristics that bind several players who seek an always new and unique game.\\n\\nThe fine line between competition and fun can disrupt the relationship between some players, after all, we are dealing with a game that needs cooperation to achieve success. But when these two elements align in a tuned way, DotA 2 becomes a complete and rewarding experience, worthy of the best matches ever witnessed in your life.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2234701446\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]The best game on earth rendered unplayable by how it\\'s handled.[/h1]\\n\\n2021 edit: Core community even more rotten than it was. 9 out of 10 players can\\'t even show respect for the basic fundamentals of the game. 9 out of 10 player does throw sissy fits like they have daddy issues though. DOTA players are old dogs. They\\'re the type of dudes that can\\'t imagine ever changing the way they play, and rage themselves into a heart attack every day. No room for growth, no room for improvement: one and done in the beginning from the mindset. Too delusional to see it. My opinion is basically still the same it\\'s been since 2019- DOTA 2 is the perfect game on earth rendered unplayable by its community/dev team\\'s handling. Pre 2019 DOTA 2 was great. Miss it dearly.\\n\\nI came back in 2020. The games are a stomp- one way or the other. You either have a free win or an autoloss; a game you couldn\\'t lose no matter what you did or a game you couldn\\'t win no matter what you did. [b][i]This is the overwhelming majority of games.[/i][/b]\\n\\nIf the matchmaker can\\'t make more even games out of 300-600k people at a given time, [spoiler]I understand that is not an easy task.[/spoiler] it\\'s pointless to keep playing. I want to win because I deserved it and I want to lose because I didn\\'t cut it.\\n\\nThe problem isn\\'t exactly \"muh matchmaker\" either, though. [b][i]It\\'s the stagnant playerbase.[/i][/b] The people playing today are the same ones that were playing 5 years ago. It\\'s why you can play a match at 3650 rating but one player will play as if they\\'re a 500 and one player will play as they\\'re a 4500. The numbers are completely meaningless because the mass can\\'t fill the pyramid. [spoiler]And the pyramid gets manipulated all the goddamn time.[/spoiler]\\n\\nThere\\'s no new traffic, no new life. [spoiler]The only new traffic is alt accounts- which is a whole other aspect of the damage the game is taking.[/spoiler] And there won\\'t be any new traffic, this game won\\'t be revitalized by bumping that 7m monthly users to a shiny 15m or 25m. Valve is not interested in doing that.\\n\\nThere is no effort to grow this game. Valve has the power to do [i]incredible things[/i], they show it every now and then- but they don\\'t do those incredible things- they let things sit around, decay, and whether you believe it or not, inevitably die. Yes, it would be dramatic to claim that DOTA is going to die next month, next year- but the further you go the more believable it becomes. [spoiler]Just look at TF2. It\\'s that OTHER valve game that is closer to its death. Neglected just like this one- just, financially aswell. You need to realize that one day Valve can pull the plug on DOTA, too.[/spoiler] The actions they take greatly damage the longevity of the game one way or the other- [b]and if you have the slightest wisdom you know it\\'s important to consider the long-term aspect of life aswell as the short-term.[/b]\\n\\nThere is no effort to grow this game because they\\'re content with milking the same 7mil with battlepasses. A short-term vision, a successful one, no doubt. We still buy everything that\\'s put in front of us because we love the game. We\\'re trapped by the exclusivity designs and such. It\\'s tragic. More on that: Exclusivity designs keep existing players attached and are completely repulsive to new players. [b]It\\'s one of the greatest diseases this game has.[/b] It\\'s upsetting to see other games picking this up aswell. [spoiler]Just imagine being a new player and seeing all of this content you literally cannot unlock. Why bother? Maybe you\\'re an existing player, but you couldn\\'t afford it at the time. Too bad. You\\'ll be just told \"too bad\"- the shitty practice will still be tolerated.[/spoiler]\\n\\nEveryone still has their pink-tinted glasses on while they look at DOTA. Do you want to know how outsiders view it?\\n[quote=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVsQnd2Ev9k -]It\\'s a miserable game for miserable people.[/quote]\\nRemember the last time this game made you feel miserable. [b][i]Then tell me if you can honestly disagree.[/i][/b] \"That\\'s just DOTA\", you can say- but it doesn\\'t have to be. Wake up. Ask for something better.\\n\\n[h1]The passion is gone. It\\'s purely business now. I hope someone reads this.[/h1]\\n\\n[h1]EDIT: ADDITIONALLY, HOW VALVE IS HANDLING TI10 SHOULD GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE EXTREME LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND SEVERE NEGLECT.[/h1]',\n",

       "  'review': 'This game saved my life.\\n\\nI am 41.\\n\\nMy ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.\\n\\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\\n\\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\\n\\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn\\'t beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\\n\\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don\\'t fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\\n\\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\\n\\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn\\'t be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\\n\\nThank you\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'Reposting since under the old review system I would be forced to \"recommend\" that people play this.\\n\\nThis game is like a shower fight between you and another naked man. You\\'re both in a small shower tub trying desperately to shove each other over while at the same time trying not to accidentally touch peens and catch the gay. \\n\\nWhen you slip over and land painfully on your ♥♥♥ the other guy, completely by accident, gets his soap-stained foot into your mouth just as you both realize somebody downstairs is hogging all the hot water. Then one of the guys from downstairs who should be helping you get back up on your feet instead comes into the room and yells at you for stealing all the hot water even though it\\'s the other way around. \\n\\nYou\\'re the noob who can\\'t get better at naked shower fights no matter how hard you try, the other guy in the tub is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ from the enemy team who mains bounty hunter, anti-mage, puck, ursa, or some other broken class, and the people downstairs who made you run out of hot water are your teammates getting last hits on what would be your kills and turning them into assists on your end. The guy who comes in from downstairs to yell at you is the teammate who, even though you\\'re farming plenty of creeps and earning plenty of gold and experience from them, insists you\\'re killing them \"the wrong way\" and are therefore an idiot noob.\\n\\nThe naked shower fight is also a one-way road: once you jump in, there is virtually no returning. You become enslaved and before long all you\\'ll ever want to do for the rest of your life is play dota. You won\\'t even want to talk to or interact with anyone from the outside world unless they are similarly enslaved, by dota (or LoL). The video game world then slowly proceeds to divide and coalesce into two and only two distinct spheres of existence and reality: people who play mobas, and people who don\\'t. Neither side ever so much as glimpses at the other for the remainder of each of its constituents\\' entire lives because its masochistic addiction level is insane enough to leave Starcraft and WoW in the dust. \\n\\nIf you complain about how slippery the surface of the showertub is, people will just yell at you because you\\'re terrible at the game and don\\'t consult the online guidebook and metagame like they do for every minute, individual step taken throughout the game. If you want to get \"good\", you are unequivocally required to follow the instruction book down to the exact letter even if it hardly makes a difference in-game, if at all. If you do otherwise, you will get yelled at. Every single time without exception. To not get yelled at, you have to assimilate into the formless mass. This is all a part of the self-enslavement process: you won\\'t come back, ever. And within a month you\\'ll find yourself just parrotting the same shit people were yelling at you for earlier, because you\\'ll be one of them by that point. \\n\\nAnd you literally will not return. You\\'ll be doing this for the entire rest of your life and will be speaking it like a language.',\n",

But in opposite site we have: full retarded community. No item choice. Unbalanced champions. Every New patch something is full killed: early game, jungle, roaming, late game, anything. Meta changes ull tell? No, just people who are making this game don\\'t know what they wanna get in result. 1 new hero pro year, with a lot of bugs and overpowered at start and later nerfed till unplayable state. If we talk about other mobas like league - there are around 4 new champs every year and around 5 old champs reworked(cuz pre rework they were boring 2 play(yes, u can rework champs, icefrog, and not just replace riki spells 10 times)). Never was so disappointed about wasted hours. Lately they are adding things what improve this game(rolesearch etc), but this won\\'t make me return in this game, minimum cuz I can predict next updates by looking at League for example.

       "  'review': \"After 7.20, if you don't play the meta characters right now, you won't win.  Team  comps at higher levels look well rounded.  Towards the bottom tiers, they whole team needs to be carries, and only meta-carries. The majority of players are low tier, so this is most of the players' experiece.  The recent buff to certain characters make some supports one-hit killers late game and other broken.  I used to think this game was better than League because the various build paths and play styles, but it seems like you must go a certain path to win games and only that path.  If you want to play various characters that might not be meta and still have a shot at winning, don't play this version of DOTA 2.  Go play league or another moba that is growing.  This game doesn't satisfy like it used to and by the way they've been making changes it doesn't look like it will change in a better direction soon.  Uninstall and come back a couple years later.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Learning Dota 2 is like learning the entire history of the world, every civilization, every war, every political situation, every nit-picky historical detail. Except valve keeps changing the history every patch.\\n\\nIt took me 1000 hours to actually say \"Huh, I think I now completely understand how to play the game properly\". And even that was achieved by being a dota nerd, watching guides, theorycrafting 24/7 while eating or sitting on the toilet or traveling or trying to sleep. It becomes an obsession, a challenge to learn the entire game. Only to unlearn and relearn everything again every major patch. It\\'s more mind straining than getting an academic education or even trying to get a PHD. I never thought of the game as worth the effort and time investment.\\n\\nSo why keep playing if one thinks it just isn\\'t worth the time investment? At first it was the damn human curiosity, experimenting every detail and enjoying the results. But after that phase 2 main reasons remained: too much free time and not having another game to play. Mainly it was the latter reason. Me and my friends would find some games, play them until we were bored, find singleplayer games, finish them, aand then there was nothing to do. So no other game? Back to dota. I hated this vicious circle. \\n\\nI tried to quit atleast 15 times, deleted the game several times while I had a really poor download speed, tried quitting by removing my monitor from the house, changed the pw of my only account in windows to something really long and gave it away to somebody so I couldn\\'t open the computer, deleted steam entirely several times and tried much, much more things to quit. I couldn\\'t. Stuck in the loop, I kept trying to improve my gameplay by watching high level players play and explain the game. \\n\\nUntil one day...\\nI came across ChiLongQua\\'s youtube channel...\\n\\nThe first video I saw, he was non-stop feeding the enemy team, while complaining about the issues in the game such as:\\n-im 5k yet i always get matched with 4k shitstains that don\\'t know how to play the game, you have to forcefully tell them on mic what to do\\n-last game my teammate gave up and fed for a puny argument and if my game gets ruined, im gonna ruin someone elses game\\n\\nMy first thought was: \"Huh, an annoying tryhard rager kid that flames everyone on voice chat just because he lost some games\". But the more I watched, the more I understood his psychology and his reasoning behind his actions. It is a long story but in the end I eventually decided to feed like him just to understand his mentality even more. And boy, was that a turning point. \\n\\nI analyzed everyones reactions as i went down mid and gave my life as a gift to the enemy team. First, I realized how shit, and inefficient the enemy team was at killing me. I ran around under their tower and they still struggled to kill me. This alone made me realize the enemy team is way worse than I am at the game. My teammates reacted to the situation like expected. But in the sentences they produced I was able to understand they are simply stupid. The results were amazing. I was enlightened.\\n\\nAfter this feeding session, I played my next game normally(while still thinking in my mind that I am the best player in the game) and I stomped that game. I stomped the next game after that. This was weird. Because I had been stuck at that my mmr for years. But the change of my mindset gained me 600 mmr in less than 10 days. Realizing that I will almost always have to carry my team if I want to win, I will always have inferior players to me in my team and the enemy team, I was able to slowly stop playing dota. I realized the game as a whole was a pile of mess, that cant be fixed, if you dont fix the players. So my hatred for dota grew day by day, and one day I deleted the game for the last time. It has been over 2 years since I last played dota. The hatred kindling, kindled by CLQ grew so big that I was able to finally quit. CLQ had saved me.\\n\\nLater I played dota again with my friends once several months when new big patches came. But I wasnt getting addicted anymore. I was able to enjoy the game with my friends again.\\n\\nThis game is a vacuum that will suck your life and soul in. There is no ending to this game. Valve will keep trying to manipulate players to come back to the game by updating, even if the game is balanced. They will ruin the balance to keep the game interesting and fresh. Because its business. More players playing = More skins sold, more crates opened. \\n\\nEven the shittiest jobs of today does at least pays you back, so you can buy food and some other things you like, keep your life going. But dota doesn\\'t. Don\\'t live dota. Most of the players aren\\'t even playing dota to have fun anymore. They play it to shout and get shouted at, after a day of stressful work. Dota 2 is a psychiatric hospital that doesn\\'t fix people, it only makes them worse.\\n\\nI certainly don\\'t regret any of my playtime I have on this game. But I am glad I dont have any more hours than what I had currently spent on it. If it wasn\\'t for CLQ and the enlightenment he provided me, I would have sunk about 5k hours into this game by now. (Sadly, he is still playing dota forcing himself to be positive and not rage. He defies his own past, defies his own opinions. Just because youtube is an income for him. His position is just sad.)\\n\\nWith that many hours, you can master any craft, study anything to become one of the best at the subject. But if you sink 5k hours into dota, you will still be an above average player. If you don\\'t go pro, you get nothing in return. Stop lying to yourself. You aren\\'t having fun playing this game. It became a stressful work a long time ago. Think about it.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t agree with anything I said, just go ruin a game, purposefully feed and analyze the other players reactions. One game won\\'t hurt. Then think about all of the above, again.\\n\\nIf you are already a high skilled but non pro player with your teenage years buried into this game, think about other games you couldve spent a fraction of time on and became one of the top players, earning all that e-sports money you can\\'t get playing dota 2. Since you never actually played any other game while not thinking about dota in the back of your head, you are unable to comprehend that there are other fun games out there, that don\\'t require wasting 10 years of your 70 year life to learn.\\n\\n03.05.2017\\nAhmet Faruk Albayrak',\n",

       "'[h1]\"You learn how to learn,  how to lose and most importantly you learn about you.\"[/h1]\\n\\nAlright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over  the span of 3 years.\\n\\n1. general thoughts and how i started:\\nI was  15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact  this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that  saying \"nothing\" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional assholes. \\n\\n2. Did i waste my youth?:\\nSo this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts \"lets learn music\"  or \"lets study\" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of \"improving\" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.\\n\\n3. time invested into dota2:\\nEVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of \"oh man i shouldve learned something  with this time.... i couldve been amazing now..\" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It\\'s kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much fucking time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.\\n\\nREWARDING: dota 2 is FUCKIGN REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start  understanding how to farm -> M .  M . R \\n\\nYOUR RANK GOES FUCKIGN UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)). \\n\\nReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY fucked up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do \\n\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive) \\n[i]hope someone will ever read this lol hit me up if you wanna chat[/i]'"
